There is a guy near my cubicle at work who is probably the happiest, most caring person I know from how I have interacted with him since he got hired a month ago. I sat with him a lot to teach him his job and he was assigned to the same team as me.

A lot of people have called him weird and made jokes about him. Even the head of the department has made comments about him while he was in earshot. He is always staying active  he does yoga in the parking lot, and if he is tired on his lunch he we still on his car( not in). Definitely a bit strange but I don't think he deserves to be treated that way for emphasizing physical and mental health.

I am a bit overweight so a week ago I asked him if I could join him and if he could help me excersize. It turns out he has a bachelor's and a masters in exercise science which was super cool. He taught me how to stretch properly and prepare for a run. We then ran and I completed my first mile in under 10 minutes( I know this sucks) and a total of 3.1 miles with stops to stretch and to slow my heart rate down. Running a 5k in segments I did not think possible. He let me set the pace and was super encouraging the entire way. He also explained his freshman year he was overweight as well and someone dragged him out and got him to excersise

Once we finished he said I should join him again next Friday as that is his "recovery" day. I got home and felt amazing. I then check my messages and this guy's has made a custom workout plan for me for the next two weeks with a note saying after I accomplish that he will see where I am and adjust it. He also put in his notes that my short terms goals should be a half marathon and long term should be a marathon. I teared up a little that someone I barely new was willing to put a lot off effort and commit to getting me in shape.

TLDR: The guy everyone was making fun of is now my personal trainer and apparently has the credentials to do that as well.

Update: Thanks you so much for the conversation in the comment below and for all those shiny award things! I have not gotten those before. I am surprised this blew up as much as it did. I have been trying to respond to everyone's questions or comments for the past hour or so. I will continue working my way through for a bit more tonight. Otherwise I will try to respond to the rest tomorrow. Also don't be afraid to reach out and be friends with someone even if no one else will give someone a chance! Every one deserves a chance at a friendship. Be like my new friend!

Second update: I am a guy and I am happily married. After seeing some comments I thought I'd clear that up. I. Just value having good friendships with other guys. Sorry if I crushed anyone's romance stories!

Third update: I do stand up for him as much as I can especially when it's a direct conversation with me. I have a strong "I don't negotiate with terrorist" policy on this.

Fourth update: apparently running a mile under 10 minutes is something to be proud of. Thank you all for the compliments. Before I put on 60+ lbs in fat I used to do it in under 7. I am out of touch with reality and I am sorry about that! You guys are all awesome BTW.

Fifth update: I think I have responded to all the questions. I am overwhelmed by all your comments, encouragement, and advice you guys have given me! I was expected maybe 5 responses but am glad I was able encourage close to 50,000 people. Also thanks for all these awards. I am not sure yet what all of them mean but will look further into them! Have a great Sunday!

Sixth update: apparently my supervisor is a reddit user and is now messaging me about it. I already put my two weeks notice in but hoping that it won't be a drama filled two weeks. Wish me luck! If you are reading this sup please don't throw me under the bus!

Seventh update:So it has been a few months since I posted this and I am still getting daily support and messages. Thank you all for your kind words. Life is going very well! The inspiration of my friend has led me to be in a lot better shape. I just finished a 22 mile kayaking trip with my wife today and last weekend I did a 12 mile hike up a mountain. I have more energy now than I have had in years. I am working as a water technician now and doing census on the side which is keeping me busy . So why was just me and my wife? Sadly my friend parted ways with the company and moved to California to work with an organization that provides assistance to firemen. It was really hard to see him go but he is continually living his life to its fullest. I am thankful for the few months I got to hang with him and I hope those out in California both treat him kindly and get to experience the kind of friendship I had with this guy. I guess real life is different than the movies but I hope some day our paths cross again. Hope you all are having an amazing day!So I’m a black guy who lived in China for a year.  Racism is quiet different in China and to be honest, it literally is  in your face &  It could even get life threatening at times. I’ve  had a lot of bad experiences but this one was one of the ones I actually liked and one I didn’t mind.

I was riding on the train in Beijing, minding my own business and all of a sudden, someone shoves an earphone to my ears from behind. And I was surprised and pissed that this happened. And lots of rude people in China, so you’re always on the edge. I turned around instantly and it’s this teenage girl and she was hyper and very happy to see me it seemed .
And then she says the most unexpected shit ever. 

She says ..         ”I like Rap Music”

Wow!!!

I was so shocked but not angry. It was just too surprising and something I wasn’t expecting after having earphones shoved on my ears. 

And I shit you not, the music was not even a black guy....it was fucking EMINEM...
The whole thing brought a smile to my face because I knew it was just ignorance and not arrogance and you can’t be mad at ignorance. She wanted to take selfies with me(selfie with a black guy) . I allowed it . We took selfies and we parted ways.I almost didn't recognize him. He grew a few inches, cut and dyed his hair,  and lost some weight. I didn't want to put him a stressful situation, so I just left him alone. He left a thank-you note on my receipt. It said: 

"Thank you for saving my life. You have no idea how much I think about you and what you did." 

I honestly wonder if I should initiate conversation. I fear it may harm him.

Edit: I'm going to say hello on Wednesday when I go back. Here's to hoping it works out. I appreciate the advice and kind words.

Update: I went back and he was there. We had a short conversation. He was ecstatic that I returned and was glad I was back before he had toreturn to his mother's home to take care of her, for she had Alzheimer's. He was leaving on a flight on Saturday and wasn't going to return. I have his phone number and an email to contact him with. 

He asked me if I made this post. Apparently he is one of us.After 5 years, 2 kids, many jobs, many homes, and many breaks from school, I finally finished my associates degree in business administration from my community college and will start university next year. It’s always been a goal of mine to finish college since I am a first generation high school graduate and now a first generation college graduate :) nobody ever told me to go to college and when I say nobody I mean NOBODY. Not any teachers, relatives, friends, bosses, it’s just something you don’t really push on a poor kid to do since it’s obvious you have to work. I never got support from anyone any time I complained about school and how hard it was to balance everything. Either way I always pushed myself to continue and now that I hit this milestone, the reaction was underwhelming from everyone including my mom and husband but oh well I’m proud of me :) thanks for reading

EDIT: OMG I did not expect all this kindness! I got anxiety when I first made the post that I decided to log off and barely check it right now. You guys have me crying and smiling at the same time! Thank you to each and every person who commented and for all the awards. I’m honestly going to print this post and keep it as an inspiration to finish my bachelors. It’s been such a crazy year I think for all of us and to know that there is still so many kind souls out there, thank you so much. You don’t know how much your words mean to me. And for everyone that is in a similar situation, college is hard and I believe in every one of you! If I was able to do it I know you can do it too ❤️I (31F) began to lose my hearing about ten years ago, when I was in the military. My husband and I got a cat about five years ago. I've never owned a cat before, so I had no idea what kind of noises they made besides "meow" so I had no context for what to expect when I heard my cat purr for the first time today. 

I was laying in bed and he jumped up next to me and snuggled into my armpit. I started to feel him vibrate like he always does and then I heard it. I was so scared at first, I didn't understand what the sound was. Then it clicked: purring isn't just vibrating! It's a sound! I can hear it! My cat has wandered off now, but I keep bursting into tears just thinking about his purr. I've never heard a cat purr before and it's so sweet. There's this ethereal quality to it I can't even describe. It has this rhythmic pattern to it. It's all nasally, but low and fluttery. 

My husband and kids are sleeping and I don't want to wake them up, but I'll tell them in the morning. I just wanted to share this joy I'm feeling with someone now.

Edit: I've never used imgur before, but I think I did this right. [Paying my cat tax](https://m.imgur.com/a/3JRXEIb). This is Kipper. Also, my family is awake and they laughed when I told them I can hear him purring. They said he sometimes whistle/snores through his nose too. I can't wait to hear that sound!

Edit 2: Thank you everyone for those cute little emoji awards. I know they cost money, so instead of giving a clover or heart eyes to me award to me, please consider using that money to buy a box of Girl Scout cookies if you're in the USA. Due to COVID-19, cookie booths around the country have been cancelled and troops are stuck with thousands of dollars of cookie inventory; individual girls (and their parents or caregivers) are stuck eating the cost. You can donate boxes if you don't want them, but any donation will help Girl Scout troops offset the cost of the excess cookies we're stuck with. Or use that money to tip your server or hospitality staff really well. 

Also, I've been amazed at quite a few sounds I didn't know I was missing. I forgot when you rip paper towels they actually make a rip sound. I heard the fan in the living room. I can hear the clock above my desk ticking. Turns out I have no idea how to whisper. My own voice sounds so strange. Consonants sound strange. The water running in tub when I was giving my toddler a bath last night sounded so loud. I can't wait to hear more!

Final edit: thanks for the love everyone! I'm glad this made so many people happy, although I really wasn't expecting it to get so popular. Unfortunately, there is one user who is threatening to find me in real life and hurt me because they believe I'm impersonating a veteran to get attention. Normally, I wouldn't let a troll bother me, but because I have kids to think about and they're threatening harm, I'm going to be deleting this account and starting over. No big deal! Stay safe, wash your hands, and thank you again for letting me share this special moment!Please discuss in a fair and civil manner. Is it orange or red and why do you think so? Leave a vote in the poll and then tell us why you voted that way in the comments.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/gr7523) So you've become immortal. Perhaps it was an accident involving a few rubber bands, a liquid lunch, and a particle accelerator. It doesn't really matter, it's done now. You now have to spend the rest of your life (*ha*) figuring out what to do with yourself.

At first you do all the dangerous stuff. Hang gliding, cave diving, crack cocaine, etc. You start stabbing yourself at the local bar as a trick to get free drinks. But you're running out of clean shirts that don't have knife holes in them.

You briefly dabble with thoughts of becoming a superhero, but crime never seems to just happen in front of you, and going out and looking for it is just so much work you guys!

You start investing for the long term. You're going to be around forever, what does 5% annual compound interest of $1 look like after 1000 years?

Oh god, you're going to live forever. What does that even mean?

You've got some time to kill, so start a hobby that'll take decades or centuries to finish. Then start a new one. Go to university to study physics and take a few hundred years to discover the quantum-gravitational theory, aka the Universal Theory of Everything. Then master every musical instrument and write a symphony, or 10. Then start doing crossword puzzles. You have time to do it all.

Don't develop close feelings for people. They'll all die, but you'll endure, and funerals are depressing (and for you, unnecessary).

You can have kids. Lots of kids. But you'll start losing track of them. They only really keep in touch for a few decades. And then they'll have kids and those kids will have kids and eventually you'll lose track of it all. Family doesn't have much meaning anymore once you have a billion or so family members but they all forgot that it was your birthday last Tuesday.

Realize that you'll outlive all of your enemies, you can afford to ignore them and just wait.  Why worry about anything, really. Climate change might make things uncomfortably hot, but you'll endure. The entire banking system may collapse trying to fund the interest on $1 deposited a thousand years ago, but eventually it will recover and you'll be there when it does.

If you want to, you can rule a country. After all, they can't kill the despotic dictator if the despotic dictator can't die. They can lock you up, but eventually all jails crumble, all regimes change.

You realize that even your country will fail at some point, and then you'll be right back where you started, bored on a Sunday night wondering what to do with yourself and all this crack cocaine you've surrounded yourself with, and why you didn't remember until just now that it was your birthday last Tuesday and how you didn't get even a single birthday card.

So forget countries, start up your own religion with you as their god. Call yourself the Undying. Religions last for a long time. The pope held massive power for over a thousand years, kings kneeling before him. You could do that.

Fund AI research. Eventually you may want a friend that won't die. Plus you'll start forgetting things. "Where did I put the bank card to that account I started a thousand years ago?". The AI can help you keep track of things.

But keep the self-destruct button close. No one will know you better than your AI companion. But one day you'll have an argument and the AI will try to trap you for all eternity. Or it will go mad and replicate itself infinitely to take over the Earth/universe. You will have to kill it. You will have to kill it and then rebuild it over and over and over again. Remember always to build in a fatal flaw that you can exploit to bring it down. You are immortal, it is your only real competition over time. It is also your only real friend.

They say that your chances of being trapped in a natural disaster are something like 0.1%. But when your life is eternal, the chances of you being trapped in a disaster becomes 100% over time. It will happen at some point. You may spend a few thousand years trapped in the rubble of an earthquake-toppled building that was built over by succeeding civilizations until eventually archaeologists or erosion or another earthquake frees you.

At some point you will lose your sanity. It's inevitable. Try spending 10,000 years buried alive in the rubble of an ancient civilization and still keep your sanity. Try to back up your memory (perhaps in that AI that you built)?

Eventually, with certainly, you will be alone. In a billion years the sun heats up enough that surface water can no longer exist on Earth, which pretty much means the end of all life.

All life except you.

In another 3.5 billion years the sun expands and swallows the Earth. Try not to be there when that happens. Maybe you should use the donations from your religion or the interest on that $1 you invested a thousand years ago to fund space research. If only you could remember the bank account number you deposited the $1 into, or if only the bank still exists and didn't collapse after some ponzi scheme they fell for a few centuries ago.

The Earth may be gone now, but you're still going strong. The universe goes on and on, for ever and ever, possibly. Eventually the stars start running out of hydrogen and helium to burn and one by one they all snuff out. The universe goes dark then, no more light, but you'll endure. With no more stars, no more radioactive elements will be created. Eventually, every element that can decay will decay down to base iron. With no more heat from stars or radioactive decay everything will cool down to near-absolute zero, which is unimaginably cold, but you'll still feel it. You'll feel it forever.

You'll still be around. Forever. In the dark. In the cold. Forever. Forever and ever.

Hopefully you'll have lost your mind long ago.Unfortunately, my parents took me on a ride on a jet plane when I was a few months old and I had been deaf since then.


We live in a third world country and since my dad worked in the army, we couldn't afford a hearing aid. I didn't have any idea what "sound" was. Today, I got a hearing aid as a present from an expat visitor and I could **hear** for the first time in my life.

He played the song "We are the world" by Michael Jackson. It was overwhelming at first but I couldn't help but fall in love with the singer's voice. His voice somehow comforted me. I experienced the peace I never knew existed.

What other songs should I listen to?

Sorry, I'm all teary after hearing for the first time. I wish I could talk to you guys via voice chat to hear everyone although I'm sure I wouldn't be able to make out what you're saying. I think if people are talking about good things, they would give me that 'good feeling' like the song. I'm not really sure of course. Thanks again!

Edit: I will definitely listen to all the songs recommended by everyone who's awesome to have made a comment and keep each and everyone updated after I've listened to the recommended songs. Wouldn't hurt to try and I'm willing to take whatever the risk haha. So far, I like the less repetitive ones like Bohemian Rhapsody. I find my eyes widen again and again while listening to Bohemian Rhapsody. I knew the lyrics and I thought it was supposed to be a sad song before I was able to hear but when I heard it, it gave more than just sad feelings. It made me feel like I was sort of floating in air. This is actually like a drug. I don't know why. Most of the times I find myself frozen as I listen to the sounds.

Edit 2: Dad and the kind gentleman who gave us the hearing aid showed me how to count the beats. They told me to hit the table along with them when the loudest shortest sound happened and showed me how to dance with the loudest sound. I had no idea dancing to the song would be this fast haha. Now I'm dancing. I thought I was supposed to feel happy while dancing but I feel like I'm riding the waves in the ocean while dancing with the music. It's more than the happy feeling. I feel sleepy and happy at the same time when the music is playing. Is this how it's supposed to feel when you hear the music while you dance?

Edit 3: Holy shit holy shit. I just got back from dancing. I'm listening to all the songs one by one and it just continues to shake my heart. I watched the Equilibrium movie and I always wanted to feel how it must have felt like when I saw Christian Bale in that scene where he heard the music. And I got gold from /u/Subliminal_Image and silver from an anonymous stranger even though I hadn't used Reddit much! Thank you thank you! I listened to Canon In D as recommended by most Redditors and my sister. The music without singers sounds totally different from the ones where the singers sing.

Edit 4: I understand the edits that thank the people who gave gold, silver etc might be frowned upon on Reddit but I just wanted to thank /u/DD2253 for giving me the Pineapple award and the anonymous users who gave me gold and silver awards. I wonder what this award does! :D If I could donate this award to somebody else I'd like to donate it.

Edit 5: I saw the comments which said they wished they could hear the songs they liked for the first time again. No idea why I'm tearing up reading them even after dancing happily with the songs. I am going to listen to all those songs and reply how I felt as I heard them for the first time. Maybe this is the least I could do for the awesome comments. 

Edit 6: My brother told me to listen to acapellas which was just the singer singing so that I could separately hear what people sounded like when they sang. It's actually different from symphonies. It's harder to process but it gives similar feelings.My husband still keeps in touch with all of his high school and college friends with various online communities.  The other day he was playing some game online with one of them, and at one point left the room.  I made small talk with his friend while he was gone, and he asked me about a project I'd been working on.  When I asked how he knew about that, he said that my husband is always talking about me and bragging about my cooking and a lot of other stuff that I do.  He said it always amazed them, because he has always been a generally sarcastic guy and disguises his compliments as insults when talking about anyone else but me.

10 years of marriage, and I love this guy more than ever.We have been feeding the crows in our area for weeks now, any scraps or leftover bits of food. They always come back around the same time each day and start making noise outside the window if we forget to feed them. 

Last week we found a little pile of coins, mostly pennies, on our back porch near to where we would throw food out. We thought the neighborhood kids are mocking us for doing this. 

Today we found another little pile and actually saw a little crow leave a penny on the pile!! This is surreal. I have heard that birds such as crows leave gifts for humans because they’re highly intelligent, but I never thought I’d experience this firsthand! We now have 39 cents, thanks to our lovely crow friends :)

—————————————————————-

Edit- THANK YOU for all the love on this post everyone! I didn’t think my silly little quarantine story would gain so much attention, it’s thoroughly made me day!She was the ‘popular girl’ in high school and I was the super tall, awkward lesbian. We were on the volleyball team together and she would always get onto me for messing up. She was never friendly to me and would always leave me out of things intentionally. I hated her personality but always had the hots for her and fantasized about her despite her treatment of me. She was beautiful and everything I wasn’t - cool and confident.

I was one year above her throughout high school, I graduated in 2015 and her in 2016. During my senior year, I made some big plays during a big game and she sort of began warming up to me. After school one day, I walked past she and her boyfriend as they were getting into a huge argument. He was getting into her face and nobody else was around. I could feel something really bad was about to happen so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I walked over to him and told him to back off. Surprisingly, he did (perks to being 6’4 and therefore bigger than most guys). He called me some choice words and went on his way.

I asked her if she was okay and she immediately thanked me for interfering. I could tell she was shook up so I offered to give her a ride home, which she accepted. Turns out she lived just down the street from me. She thanked me again and thus began a friendship. She apologized for the way she had treated me, saying she was just playing it up for the other girls and that she had matured beyond that.

Long story short, I eventually confessed my feelings towards her and she admitted that she had developed similar feelings towards me. It was confusing for her because she had never been attracted to another woman before, so it took her some time to accept it. She still claims to this day that I’m the only girl she’s ever had feelings for, all of her celeb crushes are guys and it honestly makes me proud that I was the one able to win her over. We started dating in 2016 and I proposed in February of 2018. We married last September and are currently expecting a daughter together. 

Love can be strange, but I’m so glad it turned out the way it did. I’ve only recently started opening up about our story publicly so I hope it can encourage or inspire someone out there 🙂She was giving me “kisses” but she’s a little bit of an odd doggo and won’t actually lick anyone, just touches them with her nose. 

Well I felt her little cold nose on my cheek and I was like, “hi baaaaaaabygirl, gooood girl” when she moved her nose to my ear and I winced (because that’s an odd feeling) THEN SHE SNEEZED IN IT. 

I’m so uncomfortable I feel like I need to clean parts of my body I don’t know how to reach and I’m slightly freaking out.

Edit: I’m sorry about the title. I can’t change it. This wasn’t supposed to blow up like this. It was just supposed to be a slightly over dramatic rant about my dog sneezing into my ear and how gross it felt. I’m sorry I lured you here by accident. Please have a laugh on me :)

Edit: [I couldn’t pick just one picture of my girl so here’s several, some with her big bro!](https://imgur.com/gallery/5SB5ALo) 

Edit: for those of you disappointed you didn’t get a rear licking doggo story, [here’s one. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/e1llwx/my_dog_just_sneezed_in_my_rear_and_i_feel_like_i/f8rm7ga/)

Edit #idk: I appreciate some of you thinking I’m clever enough to purposefully craft something so hilarious. I mean *just look at my name*I ducked in to our local convenience store yesterday to buy a gallon of milk. I used regularly buy cigarettes there so all the clerks knew me. I put the milk on the counter. As the clerk was walking up to scan it, he grabbed a pack of my brand. I was proud to wave him off and tell him I quit smoking three months ago. He smiled at me and said “good for you.” Thanks for the affirmation.There is a local pizza place a block or two from my house. I get pizza from there once or twice a month, not that often, and I always order the same toppings: mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and feta. 

Someone heard me ordering it and asked for the same thing. So the pizza place added it to their special board, called “The Mirarom”.

I feel weirdly honored.

EDIT: oh my goodness, everyone, I checked out for an hour and this BLEW up. I have to go to sleep, but thank you all so much for the nice messages and for sharing in my accomplishment! Y’all are the best!I'm 28. The girl I was wkth wanted to take a shower together. "Why dont you wait for it to warm up?"  I stared back at her, a million thoughts running through my head. I feel so stupid, I couldn't enjoy the rest of the night. I has no answer for her, and I always hated showers. Today I stood and waited for the shower to heat up for the first time, and it was great! 

I dont know. Have you ever done something...this dumb? I'm working on my masters and I feel like such a dumbassI’m going to try to make this short:

My ex-wife and I were married for seven years. We had three children. We got divorced over nine years ago. The first year was rough—like any divorce. Both of us had to find our place in the world. We never used the kids as a weapon, and both of us made sure equal custody was never in danger. So, things were amicable. 

We have an autistic son. His behavior in school and at home became so awful that we blamed ourselves. Our relationship got better because we were trying to figure out where we were going wrong. Her husband and I had multiple theories, but she knew the source was school. She hid an old iPhone in his backpack and recorded audio from the day. Short version: he was hit multiple times and tormented by a teacher’s aide all day. 

We went to war with the school. There were a lot of late nights trying to determine what to do. This was five years ago. 

Five years ago, she also had a baby with her husband. Her husband came to my house soon after and said, “It must have been tough seeing a guy move in with your kids. I don’t think I understood that until I had my own kid. 

Last year, they asked me to be their child’s godfather. 

The most common reaction to this—“That’s weird.”

He’s a mechanic and takes care of my car. We’re both musicians, so we play together often. I keep their kiddo for them whenever he doesn’t want to be separated from his siblings. Etc., etc., etc. 

That’s the basic rundown of our relationship over the last nine years. 


I was very fortunate to get a side gig this summer that pays very well. My kids have never been on vacation. My ex-wife’s husband have never been on a plane. None of them have ever left the country. So I bought tickets for everyone to Rome the week of Christmas.

EDIT: 

1. I will post the entire deal with my son soon. 
2. Thanks for the positivity in the comments.

Edit 2: 

There is no romantic involvement between my ex and I. I have been in a relationship for a year.

Edit 3:

I get it! I am a “LOW IQ N***** CUCK” 

Say it all you want in the comments, but I’ve seriously deleted over 20 PMs from these pathetic losers.

[My Son’s Story](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/cenc00/my_autistic_son_was_abused_by_a_teachers_aide/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)ISOLATE AND SOCIAL DISTANCE FOR GOD’S SAKE

My family has been pestering me to travel out of state to visit for MONTHS. I said no each time because my state has been shit about containing the pandemic and I always say “act in such a way that if everyone did so, everything would work out”. 

Self-quarantining sucks. I wanna go to the beach, I wanna see my family and friends, I wanna see a movie. I still said no, I still got sick. My mom is immunocompromised and I had no idea I was sick. Had I visited last week I would be filled to the brim with guilt right now. 

I was completely asymptomatic when I woke up. Then my chest felt tight, then I developed a cough, then my body started aching, my head is pounding, and my stomach is a war zone. All within around 5 hours. I’m currently sitting in the ER because I can’t walk 20 feet without feeling winded. 

Stay home. Follow guidelines. Keep everyone safe. And if we’re lucky, we can make it through this. But it only takes one overestimate of your health to spiral out of control. Please.

EDIT1: A lot of people have been asking for updates so I just wanna say thank you to everyone for their kind words of support and encouragement. I just got discharged after having the swab stuck up my nose and now I’m home settling in for a long rest. 

I posted this basically in real time, and I want to make it clear: even if I don’t test positive for this specific virus, I still contracted *something* despite following CDC guidelines as best I could. No parties, minimal shopping, etc. I’m not even sure how I got whatever is making me miserable right now. What I’m grateful for is that wearing a mask and keeping my hands clean definitely stopped the spread of whatever I have, COVID-19 or not. 

I live in a state slammed by the pandemic, so the test will take 3-5 days to come back. I can’t respond individually to everyone, but I wish you all the best and I hope you stay safe.Unlike most of my family, I love wearing a mask. I think it's a great accessory and I don't have to worry what half my face looks like. I recently got some really nice fitting black masks and I feel better than ever in my outfits.

I hope in places like America masks can start to be considered normal. Feel like you might be coming down with a cold but have no choice but to go grocery shopping? Wear a mask. Having an off day and want to cover your face? Wear a mask. Have a nice mask that fits your outfit? Wear that bad boy. 

At the very least, I hope in progressive areas it can be normalized. I just think that'd be neat.It's never happened before. She's huge on manners and would never discuss anything like farting or pooping, let alone do it in front of someone. I have heard her fart in her sleep before and she would get embarrassed if I mentioned it, so I usually shut up about it. I mean, it's just farts. But we've been quarantined with our 4 kids for weeks now and it's... it's a lot. A few hours ago we were sitting on the couch, drinking our coffee and she just let it out. There was a moment of silence followed by a look of defeat in her eyes and a simple "sorry."

I'm so happy. It's just a fart, it's weird but it was such a liberating, humorous moment for the two of us and it made my day.Edit: Well shit. That blew up. I was expecting a couple of likes and comments. I don’t know what all the karma does, but thank you for all the generous awards. 
I tried to reply to as many comments as I could, especially ones sharing their own experiences. Let’s beat the shit out of depression. Today I cleaned all of my makeup brushes. Biggest accomplishment of the new year.
Thank you everyone for reminding me that I’m not alone if I don’t want to be. 

I lost my freelance job on Monday and am not healthy enough to hold down a full time job. I have been planning suicide for years, and have collected all of the methods. Tuesday, wrote a suicide note, letters to family, the whole schtick. 8PM was when I was going to end it, but I decided to call the suicide hotline at 7. The hotline kept me alive bu calling me every hour. Two days later, I woke up, ate breakfast, cleaned my house (even did laundry), threw out the trash, lit my favorite candle, did a quick exercise and have my favorite cake baking in the oven right now. I’m pretty f**king proud of myself. My next step will be to throw out the medication I was going to take and burn/rip/trash the suicide notes and letters. Hopefully I’ll get there soon, but I’m going to let myself take things slow.
For anyone depressed or suicidal; you’re not crazy, you’re in pain. If it’s difficult to reach out for help, try calling a suicide hotline even if it’s to talk to another human before you end your life. They will be kind and they will take care of you.

Here’s the cat tax haha 

https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/f794j7/day_after_i_almost_committed_suicide_my_cat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfI see subs like r/estoration, r/explainlikeimfive, r/HumansBeingBros and even just users who just go above and beyond in the comments to engage and do things like send food to strangers, explain jokes/ideas/really anything to people who are curious. 

I've made significant progress gardening thanks to people on r/gardening, like, how fire is that? Strangers educated me on how to restore my basil and plant a tree for the first time in my life. 

Reddit is fucking amazing, thanks to lots of kind and thoughtful users. Give yourself a pat on the back for fostering community online; I feel that's utilizing technology for the the highest good. 

Also, place for animal gifs!I'm about to graduate and get my first full time job in a couple of months. Meanwhile, I'm still living the poor plebejian life.

I always get the cheapest 39 cents no name pasta. However, due to all the panic buying, almost all pasta was sold out. Except for the expensive brand pasta, which usually costs 1.43€, but it was reduced to 77 cents for some reason. It's in a fancy carton package with a little see through window. The cheap pasta I get is just a plastic bag.

&#x200B;

So I got the expensive pasta, but I still bought the cheapest pasta sauce for 79 cents. I cooked the pasta 15 minutes ago. What the actual fuck. I cooked it, and it's still thin. But it's not hard. It's stretchy, but it doesn't rip. You don't have to drown it in sauce until it's edible, no, it tastes good even without the sauce. I mixed it with the sauce. What is this. I didn't know pasta could have physical properties like that. I can't go back to 39 cents pasta.

Now imagine you're rich and this x100 is your average meal.I work in a pharmacy and got a call from a customer today asking me how much her prescription was. I told her it was $249. She tells me with everything going on she can't afford that right now. Before she hangs up, I tell her I can try finding a discount/trial card online (on my own phone by the way) and call her back.

She hangs up. The trial card website isn't working so I call the company. I spend 15 minutes on hold. Then talk to a representative and she gives me information to bring the cost down to $15. I could have hung up but I saw the customer paid $249 in March. So I ask the representative if I could use the card for a script nearly a month old? She says we can try. I try and boom it works!

So, I call back the customer all excited! I tell her, not only is the script going to be $15 today but we will have $234 to give back to her! She semi-thanks me and hangs up!! No excitement. No oh my gods! No thank you so much! Guess I'm just expected to do that for her.

Oh well! Since she wasn't excited, what is exciting you today/this week reddit? What made you happy!? I want to share some excitement with someone.

Edit: holy cow! Thanks for the gold and silver strangers! As I've said below I just was doing my job. I made this late last night before bed and just wanted to share a little excitement with everyone. Hope everyone out there is doing well and if you aren't, I'd love to keep hearing even the littlest of things that made you excited (even if it's something as small as you had a good meal).

Edit #2: thanks one more time to everyone for commenting and the kind comments! This blew up way more than expected and it made my Wednesday! Hope everyone is doing well out there and stay safe and positive!Here's some bubble wrap. 🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘🔘

And headphones hurt my ears, so that's off the table.



Edit: Omg how do I turn of notifications hahaha this is stupid. 

My phone just won't stop vibrating every 15 minutes and I'm expecting a call so can't turn off sound.

Edit 2: Figured it out, thank god it's over jeezI literally cannot stop laughing about this, and it's killing me, so I had to share. Basically, the title sums up the beginning of the story. My boyfriend works at McDonalds, and when he gets off sometimes I stop by to talk to him before he goes home. Well, while we were talking, suddenly someone called his name. Both of us turned, and he was like, "Mrs. (name)?!?"

We walked over and he started talking to this random lady about how surprised he was to see her. Turns out she was his 2nd grade teacher who moved to texas (while we live in the northern US so Texas is quite a ways away) who had been driving through our town, and just happened to stop at the right McDonalds, at the right time, to run into him. He introduced me, and I talked to her for a little bit, and then my boyfriend and the teacher told me that when he was in 2nd grade, every SINGLE time her husband would come into the room, he would chant "Kiss her!" until the husband did, and while other kids said "eww" he apparently always cheered.

Well after we said goodbye, as we were walking away, the teacher and her husband rolled down their car windows and chanted, "Kiss her!"

And when he kissed me, they cheered. It was probably the most wholesome thing I've experienced in quite some time!

Edit: wow! thanks for the awards guys! I've never had a post this big before, I'll have to share some of your kind comments with my boyfriend!

Edit 2: I just read some of the comments. For those wondering, my boyfriend and I in highschool. This would have been about 8 years ago, maybe 9, I'm not sure lol.

Edit 3: I just read my post to my bf, he said thanks for all the nice comments! He was surprised at all the attention this got, but we're both grateful! Thank you guys so much!I was at Starbucks getting a coffee and I noticed one of the cashiers kept staring at me. I did not recognize her, so I just thought meh whatever.

I'm walking to my car and that woman is yelling after me. She asked if I'm (not saying my real name) and I said yes.

She started crying and said she was sorry over and over. I'm standing there so confused and then it clicked. This is one of the girls that shoved me into walls and stole my backpack.

I tried my best to comfort her. I said it's okay, we're in our 30s now and I've been over it. She refunded my coffee and gave me a 25 dollar gift card. People change. I'm glad I let all that stuff go.My husband and I have a good relationship, and I am close with his family. He is a huge momma's boy,  but in a healthy way.

Like everyone, my husband sometimes goes through spells where he has a bad couple of days and needs some cheering up. When this happens, most of the time I can help him through it, but occasionally he just needs some extra support.

He's been experiencing one of these spells recently. It happened because of some things involving his hometown, and after a day I realized that he needed to talk to someone else, especially since I don't know most of the people involved.

As I have for the last few years, I text my mother in law to let her know that he was having a rough time and could use a phone call. After I got home from work today, my husband and I were relaxing on the couch watching TV when I heard his phone ring. His voice immediately perked up and I heard him chatting happily, then a little more reserved as he asked her for advice about the situation.

After a while, my husband came back into the living room and said something along the lines of, "Wow. That was Mom. She always seems to know when I'm upset, and just what to say."

It makes me so happy to know that my mother in law and I conspiring together to cheer him up actually works. Watching him go from feeling down in the dumps to loved and protected is the absolute best feeling.

If your cup is full enough, don't forget to go the extra mile to help someone today.

&#x200B;

EDIT: You guys, I had no idea this was going to blow up. Thanks so much for the kind comments and awards! You are all so incredible. My heart is very full as I type this.

One thing I didn't mention but I think is important is that I have a very strained relationship with my mother/family. I wish I could call her and get that love and support. I was a little jealous at first, but knowing that including my husband's family makes him happy made it easy to get over. 

My mother in law is an incredible woman. I love her very much and am very grateful to have her in my life, and even more grateful that she and my father in law taught my husband how to be an amazing man. They deserve much of the credit!I have been skipping meals to be able to afford food for my kids since they were born seven years ago. 2020 was the first time I managed to go a whole year without doing this.

For me this is a huge accomplishment but I am too embarrassed to share it anywhere else.

Skipped meals over last few years (only started tracking number in 2016 to see how I was doing each year)

2020 - 0
2019 - 45
2018 - 110
2017 - 137
2016 - 184

Kia Kaha to those out there struggling.Also: 
I am a woman 

I am black woman

I am a middle aged black woman 


In all these years I can count on one hand the number of times I've revealed all three of these at once. Revealing each one individually already has the propensity to bring the worst Redditors to the table. I can't begin to tell you the names I've been called or the hurtful stereotypes I was expected to defend or debate because I revealed my gender, race or age over the past decade on Reddit. 

But I never engage with those seeking to attack or debate due to the reveal..as wasting my time fighting a faceless battle on the internet with some jackwagon that feels powerful because they are able to hide behind their keyboard is pretty stupid to me!

But don't get me wrong.. the past decade on Reddit hasn't been all bad. Not way! I developed a phenomenal friendship offline with a Redditor in my city after selling concert tickets to her .. she's now one of my dearest friends.  

Also, I live in this city without my family. Several years ago I found myself in an abusive relationship during a pretty low, lonely and emotionally trying period of my life. I was an emotional zombie due to the sudden death of my mother and the professional struggles I encountered while trying to stabilize myself professionally and assimilate to a (less diverse) new city where I knew no one. After many doors being slammed in my face professionally, being alone, I gave up on myself and invited the wrong man into my life, putting myself in a worse situation. 

Long story short.. Something in me finally clicked and I gained the strength to walk out. (The previous week, I'd been in the hospital as I'd "fallen" down a flight of stairs). The firefighters that showed up knew something was wrong but I was afraid to tell them what was going on and what had happened. Yeah, he pushed me. 

But on this night, I grabbed my little dog, my car keys and my wallet..got into my car and sped away. I had no plan. For some reason, that night I posted on Reddit..scared, tired, confused, emotionally drained and broken. Several Redditors in my area came to my rescue..both men and women, offering me lodging for the night, to come and meet me for coffee, numbers to community resources and more, so much help. I rented a room at a Motel 6.. and met a Redditor for coffee, she chatted with me until the sun came up and continued to check in on me the following day. I moved one week later into the very comfortable home of friend of hers that needed a roommate. I had no job at the time, I was on unemployment and had a severance from the company that had laid me off previously (that was quickly dwindling as I'd turned to alcohol after my mothers death). 

I found new employment soon after moving in with her and I know the patience, trust and the offer of a stable home and safe space I so desperately needed during that dark phase of my life was the springboard I needed to believe in myself again and get back to the life I deserved to live. The kindness will never ever be forgotten as long as I live as I shudder when I think of where I could have ended up as the depression, alcoholism and bad choices had me in their grasp. 

7 years later.. my life is drastically different. I am back on the path of living the quality life I lived prior to moms death. I am stable, financially and mentally. I've a phenomenal career and want for absolutely nothing. But man oh man, that was a bad night, I was on a horrible path and those Redditors were there for me. No judgement, just a desire to help in any way they could. 

So while Reddit has changed a lot over the past decade, one thing that hasn't changed is that there are still Redditors on this site that truly care about their fellow human beings that Reddit alongside them. I guess thats why after a decade... this feisty middle aged chocolate girl (that doesn't look a day over 25.. I promise.. ha ha) is still happily Redditing. :-) 

It's been an interesting 10 years... wonder what the next 10 will be like? 

Thanks for reading my little ramble.. 
Aloha and Thanks Reddit. 


UPDATE:  Holy guacamole guys.. Thank you so much for all the love and the beautiful comments. And I've been gilded??? I can't even right now. I'm so emotional right now y'all.., dammit Reddit is the tits! Y'all are some cool people out there. Keep on being awesome!!!  

And thank you for making my 10th Reddit Bday so damned memorable. My girlfriend of almost 2 years went out drinking with some friends last night. At some point, she texted me she loved me, and then about five minutes later she called me. I asked her what was up and she said "I told all my friends that I had texted you I love you, but I don't remember if I did so I wanted to tell you I love you" and honestly it was the cutest thing ever. She then started going on about how she was all mine and nobody else could have her. I don't know how I managed to get such an amazing girlfriend but honestly I'm blessed16 yrs ago i was hospitalized because my father beat me up so badly. 12 yrs ago my family and i moved to the US. 12 yrs ago i learned that girls shouldn’t go to college. 6 yrs ago my parents disowned me. 6 yrs ago i went to college and managed it all by myself (and with some financial aids and loans). 3 yrs ago i was living in my car, showering at the school gym, and had $3/day for food. 2 yrs ago I graduated from college with a job offer. Today i woke up in my boyfriend’s arms who loves me very much. Today i woke up to see my dog peacefully asleep on our bed. Today i have a decent paying job doing what i love. Today i have my own condo. Today despite the pandemic and craziness happening out there, i enjoy life and the unconditional love from my dog (and of course my boyfriend). It will get better if you fight for it, so keep it going :)

Edit: Holy macaroni! Thank you so very much for all the kind words y’all. I don’t think i had ever had this many birthday wishes. Thank you!! Keep on pushing. You will get through it 😭😭

Edit2: Alright folks, you have convinced me that humanity is still genuine and gracious. Please keep spreading love and hope. Many of us will and still need it to keep on fighting and surviving. All the best wishes to all of y’all. Gotta say that I didn’t expect today to be an emotional day... good emotions at least they all are 💜💜💜💜

Edit3: 20 hrs after my post, i learned from internet strangers my story is only one of the many untold ones. Reddit, in 20 hrs, you’ve taught me love and inspired me to keep on inspiring because i am the lucky one that pulled through hardships. Please keep on pushing and shining your light even in the smallest. You never know who you’d touch. Keep being kind. Keep pushing, you will get through it. 

Update: I am from Indonesia. I do keep tabs of my parents. I know where they live and how things are. We don’t have family dinners or plan vacations together, but i know that they are well, and they also know where i live and know of my current life. Never admit their faults or recognize my successes. For work, I’m an industrial engineer at a food and beverages company.I knowingly had people on my Hulu account who I didn't recognize. I was too lazy to fix it only because all they did was watch stuff I'd never watch. There were 4 different unknown devices using my account. Then two days ago, a 5th one showed up and changed my email, password, and account settings to add on everything you can add on. My next charge was supposed to be $50+ a month. I had the $11.99 package. 

I caught it and fixed everything. So good going, 5th guy. You ruined free Hulu with no ads for 4 other people because you got greedy. And shout out to the hackers of my account who didn't change anything of mine for a few months. Just because you're a "bad" guy doesn't mean you have to be a bad guy. To the guy who was watching Daria on it, sorry you couldn't finish. I saw how far you were getting the entire time. To the guy who had the device "andy's iphone," maybe change the name of your device because I think I know what your first name is. But anyway, you're a cool guy. To the 5th guy, you're a moron. You got too greedy too quick. Fuck you. You shoulda just used me to watch Hulu without the live tv thing. I woulda had no issues with it.

To Hulu, please add a two factor authentication option to accounts. Thanks.After years of taking my kids to get their flu shots, sometimes kicking and screaming...I totally forgot about it this year because we were so busy.  I get a call from the pharmacy today asking if it’s ok to vaccinate my 13 and 17 year old who walked over there after school.  I’m so proud of them for making this proactive healthy decision without forcing them!I've had bad teeth my entire life.

I was adopted and raised by older people who had already had their teeth removed so dental hygiene wasn't something that crossed their minds. They also were not very well educated on how important dental health was considering the way they grew up.

I do not blame them for it. They didn't know much better.

All of my teeth were either broken, decaying, or both.

I was very self conscious about my smile and I never wanted to talk to anybody. 
I also never had the funds to afford much dental work so for years, I have been suffering. I couldn't eat properly, I had nights where I couldn't sleep because if tooth pain, and I was just all around miserable. I had constant toothaches and abscesses. It was hell.

As my dentist was pulling my teeth yesterday, she told me almost every single tooth I had was abscessed. Every one was infected and she told me she was sorry because I had to be in pain. She said I was one tough woman because most people she knows with even one abscess is in excruciating pain and I was walking around like nothing was wrong with more than 15 abscesses.

I told her it was an every day thing for me so it was really all I knew. I didn't know a life without mouth pain.

It's the day after, my gums are very swollen, they're sore, talking and eating is really weird, but I am so happy for it.

I'm happy to have the soreness and the forced soft food diet and the strange sensation of closing my jaw more than it should because I know this is the beginning of a better, happier, healthier me.

I get my dentures on a few months and that'll be a new adventure in itself.

I'm just so happy. I hate sounding like I'm bragging so I can't really talk about this with anyone I know. I just wanted to share my happiness with someone. 

Thanks for listening ❤️ 

Edit: thank you all for the well wishes and the awards :) I understand the "rip inbox" phrase now :P 

I am unable to answer all of your comments but I truly appreciate all of you. ~~I also appreciate that there was not a single rude comment or judgemental person.~~ You're all exactly what everyone should strive to be like ❤️ 

A couple rude comments were posted but hey, what can ya do lol. I'm not here to justify my life to anyone so they can continue being angry and bitter.

Once I receive my dentures, I'll be posting an update with them, as requested kindly by a few people :)My family has owned a fine dining italian restaurant since before i was born. Most all of my childhood memories are in that restaurant. Everyday after school i’d go do my homework at the bar, i’d follow my dad around the kitchen and help with little things like making salads, and i will never forget making my first pizza at 4 years old. Whenever it stormed really bad and we lost power my family would go and sleep on the floor in the dining room — it was always a safe space. It was always somewhere for us to go, something for us to do, something that needed constant watering and attention. It’s been my family’s livelihood for my entire existence. It’s kept my belly full as well as my heart. It’s my father’s lifelong work and it’s made me respect him sooo much after 30 years of being there to cook for 14+ hours a day. I don’t know who i’d be without this restaurant. It’s shaped me in ways that i couldn’t possibly explain over a reddit post. It’s made me confident, brave, not scared of a little heat, and i’ve built incredible relationships with a staff that i’ve been so lucky to work with for so long. 

I started taking it seriously when i was about 15. I was a busgirl at first. And then i was a hostess. And when i got a little older i became a server. I wasn’t very good at that one, especially after spilling red wine on one-too-many older women and embarrassing myself beyond compare. I realized at 18 or so, that like my father, i was a cook. I’m 24 now and i’ve been cooking alongside my dad everyday since i realized i had a knack for it. It’s been beautiful, exhausting, exhilarating, very mentally and emotionally taxing — just an overall whirlwind of emotions every single day. I even made the crazy decision to drop out of college to run the restaurant full-time. I love it though. I love working with my family. I love making people happy and seeing them enjoy the food we work so hard to make. 

Tonight is our last shift ever. Things were going so well over the holidays this past winter but ever since covid hit, it’s been a different story. We had to close to the public for 3 months. And since we’ve been open with limited occupancy, we’re not pulling in those great numbers that we once were. We can no longer afford the rent at our building and had to make the tough decision to close our doors for good. But besides that, it’s time. My parents are in their 60’s. My dad can’t do it anymore. His health is starting to drastically fail because of all the years being constantly on his feet. and he doesn’t want me to have the same life that he did, never being able to give any part of life besides work real attention. My mom and dad are ready to retire and i don’t blame them. 

I’m nervous about tonight. After all these years, this very well might be the last restaurant shift i ever work. I don’t know what the future holds for me, but i don’t think i have any interest continuing my cooking career elsewhere. I decided that without the restaurant, there’s not much keeping me in our town so in October i’m going to take a big risk and move across the country. I’m terrified. I’ve been terrified every day leading up to today. It’s hard to imagine what life is going to be like for me after we close our doors tonight. I’ve just never known anything else. 

I thought it might feel good to tell this story to some faceless strangers. If you read this far, thank you. 

Please continue to support your locally-owned restaurants. The families who own them put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into running them. Tip your servers well. Thank the chefs if you run into them. Enjoy good food for the rest of your life and eat it with passion. Cheers and buon appetito.

EDIT: the response from this has been absolutely INCREDIBLE. thank you so much for this amazing outpour of love. the shift just ended. i’m sitting in the office alone and thinking about it all, reading these amazing messages from people all across the globe. you’re all wonderful and if it’s any consolation, you’ve made my heart feel so warm. i feel a bit in shock and ready to drink some tequila and enjoy the rest of the night with my coworkers in true restaurant fashion. i’m going to try to respond to all of you in due time. thank you so much. 

2. since this blew up i thought i’d shoot my shot and say i’m planning on moving to Pittsburgh in october. i don’t have a job lined up so if anyone has any openings, let me know! i’m a hard worker and terrified to move with no plans. i just know it’s time to get out of South Carolina. also if you live in pittsburgh and are looking for a new friend, also message me! i don’t know anyone there and would love to meet some of you Yinzers.

3. a lot of people saying they don’t understand how we don’t have enough money to stay open after 30 years. you need to understand that my parents are old. they do have money put aside. but we moved into a newer, bigger location 5 years ago and our asshole landlord doubled the rent 2 years ago. my parents have been putting money from their own pockets into the restaurant for the last year or so. they could keep it up for a few more years, sure. but then they’d lose all their retirement money. the future of restaurants, especially fine dining, is very uncertain right now. my parents would rather retire now and be able to live off their profits for a few years, than put all their remaining money into it for the next 5-10 years and then have nothing. it’s clearly a big decision we’ve been going back and forth on for the past few months. we came to this decision. i respect them for pulling out now at the end of our 5 year lease instead of risking it all. they deserve this. they deserve retirement. it’s time for them to rest and enjoy their time together.

4. so many people are asking why a random place like pittsburgh. i don’t know. i’ve been obsessed with PGH since i was in early highschool and just haven’t been able to get it out of my head. i like the bridges. i like the neighborhoods. i like the hills. i like the parks. and the cobblestone roads. PNC park is the most beautiful ballpark in the country. i love the pride pittsburghers have for their city (something that i never quite felt from the town i grew up in, regardless of the restaurant). i think it’s the most beautiful city in the united states. my favourite artist in the world, mac miller, is from there. it’s a city but it’s not this huge sprawling metropolis like chicago, or NYC, or philly, or LA. i want to be cold. i want to meet strangers with funny accents and have them show me the secret spots in the city. i want to fall in love with pittsburgh like how the people who have lived there their whole lives love it. why not pittsburgh? it seems like the perfect place for me. 

pittsburgh people, keep messaging me!&#x200B;

i got bullied a lot and i never really had a lot of self esteem. With these insecurities i also was less attractive and so on.

i got better at it over the years and don't care about it as much as before. I knew reddit but haven't signed in till this year.

I wrote a comment back then that got some likes and having people agreeing with my POV or comment or finding it worthy to upvote is still leaving a feeling of satisfaction and approval. Since i have been here i also saw the dark sides of this world, but once you know how to move in here, i got really fond of it.

I got a positive reception in my social environment and i started to stand up for myself more with less doubt and being generally calmer. I would have never thought how impactful this is.

Edit: thank you kind stranger for my very first gold!

Edit 2 : Holy cow! I just went for a few hours and i came back to this! Thank you all so much, i mean the awards and all the upvotes and your kindness. I am thankful and kinda speechless at the same time. You are making me blush.

Edit 3: I just woke up and saw what happend over night, and i am beyond words to describe properly how i feel. Every single one of you: thank you, that you took time to read this and saw "me". Thanks to all the very kind strangers for the awards! I think this is a very wholesome moment and i am enjoying it, and all thanks to you all!i can’t tell you how annoying it is when someone texts me complaining how i haven’t replied. don’t get me wrong, i always reply when it’s like an important question or when trying to make plans. but texting all day is exhausting and traps me into staying in my phone when i so badly wanna get away from it. i just wish people didn’t mix up minimal replies with hating them or something. 

also this is only in regards to friendships, relationships are a different ballpark. but PLEASE stop making your friends feel like terrible people for not replying to you. 

thank youMy daughter had her first boyfriend. 

She’s in middle school and it’s lasted a couple of weeks now, so it’s pretty serious as far as pre-teen relationships go. I’ve managed to get past my initial panic to remember how big of a deal my first “boyfriend” was. 

I’ve decided to not be too overbearing, as my reaction to her first relationship is going to shape how she talks to me about future ones. I don’t want her to feel like she can’t talk to me, so I’m supportive and casually curious when I talk to her about it. 

So far, it’s all goo-goo eyes and butterflies. 

She introduced me to him a couple nights ago, though sort of by accident. He saw us at the local grocery store and came up to say hi. She turned red as could be and covered her face, so afraid that I was going to interrogate or yell at the kid. I shook his hand and introduced myself. He was super polite and seemed really nice. My favorite thing was him turning back to her to tell her “Told you it wasn’t going to be that bad.” I’m not gonna lie, I laughed at that. 

She came home today after spending some time walking around our little town with him and she just couldn’t stop smiling. She even asked me “Have you ever felt so happy you could just burst?” when she got home before practically skipping to her room. 

Puppy love is just the cutest thing.

Edit: Thanks for the wholesome award and silver, lovely strangers!

Edit 2: And thanks for the Platinum! 
You all have been beyond words!

Edit 3: And more thanks for the Gold and all the other awards. You’re all so kind and wonderful

Edit 4: You all have been so supportive and amazing. I never imagined that this would gain the attention that it did! I haven't been able to keep up with it, but just know that I think you're all absolutely fantastic.So, I'm a delivery guy and my vehicle of choice is a bicycle. Today I had a delivery three kilometers away from the restaurant which may not seem like a long way, but it really is in this hot weather. 

Anyway, I arrived to the adress, and as soon as I came, the girl who ordered the food came out with a crispy glass of cold water and told me that she had seen me on the bicycle and thought I'd like some water. 

Honestly, this may not be such an interesting story, but it was one of the most wholesome experiences I've had in my life. Today was a bit rough for me and this girl absolutely made my day. If you're reading this, thank you so much, water girl! My faith in humanity is restored.

What made your day today?As the title suggests, I'm just happy. During such times, I am trying to look for happiness in the little things. Hope you all have a lovely day.

Edit: thank you for the upvotes, my first award and all the nice comments. Thanks a ton!!Every time I call it's what I assume an older man, a younger man, and a young woman. And they don't go through any of the stupid pleasantries I hate. My favourite by far is the older man. I call, he picks up and goes "yeah, whadda ya want?" 

So I tell him my address and "hangs up". 30 minutes later, my pizza's here, never had a problem. 

I love that, I give them good reviews and I love their pizza.

Makes me wonder why we bother with all the pointless formalities we all hate.My gf did the cutest/funniest thing the other day. I've been getting into cooking steak for us recently and so she did the sweetest thing by going to the local market to buy meat from a butcher. got us 5 lbs of NY strip steak which i was floored by. The next night she wanted to show me something on her phone, i happen to glance at one of the tabs she had open and it had the following typed on a google search bar "how to speak to a butcher". i thought it was hilarious and innocent. she immediately blushed from embarrassment. i assured her that i thought it was cute and it made me feel warm inside. Shes the greatest.And she was absolutely terrible, one of the worst I’ve ever heard. But she was singing at the top of her lungs, and I loved every second of it. She had already told me she never sings in front of people so I thought it was awesome that she felt so comfortable.Due to the limitations of foster care, I cannot identify him, or post his name or picture on social media. So, I won't \- but man, do I want to. I want to shout it from the rooftops. He's breaking the cycle of poverty. He is more likely to have children that go to college. For now he wants to do mechanical engineering, and he's already into robotics and 3D printing. He's going to kill it.

Join me in celebrating tonight. Raise a glass to the rare, *rare* foster kid that makes it out OK. He's got 4 younger siblings that get to watch him set the pace. He's going to be their hero.

\*Edit\* Didn't mean for this to be self\-congratulatory if it comes across that way. My wife and I have been in this boy's life for only about 6 months. 100&#37; of the credit goes to him and him alone, I'm just happy to be here to support him.

\*Edit 2\* Reddit Gold? 2,000 up doots and climbing? I was always worried that my top post would be some silly cat video. Glad it was something nice about my kid instead. Yay internet, you rock.

\*Edit 3\* I've read every single reply up to this point, and tried to comment when I thought I could provide value. Thank you all so very much for the kind words. Both of my teens will be reading this post and your advice, congratulations, and other kind words will hit their mark. I am tired now and want to get back to an awesome weekend with the family \- we are attending a film shoot thanks to a different reddit post about my other foster kid from a few months ago! Please continue to spread good thoughts and if you can, help a foster kid get into school. Killer Mike is speaking about a different topic that affects young people, but he's spot on, [get them educated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhudugDROn0).Today I was feeling brave, and since I’m now married I knew I wouldn’t be able to hide my marriage for much longer. Some of my coworkers who knew had previously almost spilled the beans in front of our boss. 

So I Skyped my boss today, and long story short I told him that I was lesbian, and that my wife and I were recently married. He looked kind of disappointed, and said something along the lines of ‘I’m sorry, but we can’t have you on the team if you are this way. I wish you luck for the future, but I think it’s time you find yourself another job’. 

I was a fifth grade teacher and I was very fond of my students, I hope that they get another teacher who will be suitable. 

Also just for some background, where I live gay marriage is legal but not widely accepted. My country is mostly catholic.

Edit: Just to clarify, this was something I decided to do because it was affecting us in other ways. I was sick of not being able to invite my partner to events and the like. Was it a mistake? I guess so. I just kind of hope that if I take action about this it can be a way to get people talking about it. I love living in Guatemala, but I’m desperate for members of the lgbtq+ community to have more rights here.

Edit 2: I am from Guatemala

Edit 3: thanks so much for all the kind words and advice. It is so appreciated. I will try and update on this as much as I can without compromising my privacy.

Edit 4: I didn’t Skype him specifically to tell him this, he always meets with most of the teachers in the team every week so I decided to tell him then.I don't really have anyone in real life who I can tell this too, so I hope I can share it with you reddit and hopefully give some hope to anyone still struggling.

I've spent a long time passively suicidal. My mental health has been honestly a shit show since I was 14 (I'm 20 now), but last year, for the first time, I truely started trying to get better. Quit self harming, quit restricting/starving, quit drinking, quit isolating myself. It was hell on earth. But I did it.

And... it's paying off. For the first time in a long time I have hope for my future. I went travelling. I'm doing a degree I'm actually passionate about now. I'm mending my relationship with my family. I've found medication that works and I'm actually taking it.

I just realised that I want to be alive right now. I have things I'm looking forward to. Honestly I have tears in my eyes writing this, I never thought I'd get here.Last month I got my mom a Reddit Account and set her up with only the “nice” subreddits. After a month of lurking she made her first comment today. She was so nervous and excited to make her comment, as soon as she pressed enter she stood up  hollering

 “I did it!! I said something to the internet!” 

Small pause...... 


“Oh my goodness... someone liked it? It has an orange 1! Someone liked my comment!!” 

I start smiling and enjoy her excitement. I don’t tell her.... she is too innocent and lovely to ruin it. 

Later in the evening, she told me there are 5 upvotes now.  

You’ve made someone very happy today internet strangers, she is very happy.Every time I do laundry I’m always a little upset that the clothes I’m wearing aren’t getting washed. It’s like the task is somehow never complete! I don’t know how else to describe itI “homemade” them in the food processor with chicken thighs, broccoli, cream cheese and a little cheddar cheese. Then used cookie cutters to make Dino shapes (he was in kindergarten at the time, and as we only did homemade food, he was jealous of his classmates!), dipped them in egg and coating and baked them. I used to make “egg” shapes with the leftovers and always put one in each freezer bag that would then be his school lunch. 

I’m so freaking happy that he loved his homemade chicken Dino nuggets so much that he missed them into his teenage years. I sent mom and him the recipe. He replied with “I think I’ll make these but only as eggs”. It put a huge smile on my face.Does anyone else feel the same way? It’s legitimately making me so upset thinking of sitting in a cubicle for hours a day. I don’t know if it’s I hate my job or just reacclimating is a stressful thought. 

How does everyone else feel?As a male it’s insanely frustrating to browse women’s clothing and see all of the unique styles they have. From the draping, silhouettes, layering, and asymmetry, to the colors, neck lines, and details. There are so many cool and unique options.  

Then I look in the men’s section and it’s all the fucking same.   

Crew neck or vneck  
Straight cut or slim cut  
A sea of solid color patterns and primary colors  
Little to no small details  
No draping  
No asymmetry  
You want to layer? Here, wear this plaid shirt unbuttoned over a grey tee shirt. If you want to get really crazy with it, swap out the tee for a long sleeve Henley and cuff the sleeves on the outside .......  

I’m so tired of having to buy clothes from expensive specialty stores just to find something unique. 

Men deserve more variation.

Edit: Obligatory edit.Everybody else was getting ready to run errands and I told him it’d just be us hanging out at home for a few hours. He jumped up and down and yelled “yay! No adults!” I reminded him I’m in my mid 30s and he said “yeah but you play with me like a kid, so no adults!”

I was deeply flattered.I am a 35-year-old loser.

I never went to college for fear of being in debt.  I never got married for fear of being left.  I never pursued a dream for fear of not making it come true.  I've never owned a home.   I have no friends.  I have no family.  I really have no noteworthy accomplishments to date.  What this year has taught me, though, changed everything.

I've been lurking on Reddit for years now (I'm addicted, I admit).  I've read some great stories here, so I wanted to share my journey this year with the rest of you.  If this inspires (or amuses) at least one person then I feel it was worth sharing.

This year began by me pretty much jinxing the entire year for myself.  I remember saying "There's no way this year can be worse than last year." to a co-worker of mine.  I'm not really superstitious, but I can't help but laugh at the irony.  Anyway, around February I started developing some pretty bad health issues, including an ER visit.  The illness was pretty disruptive to my life, making it difficult to enjoy pretty much anything.  On top of that, I received yet another insulting pay raise at my job of 8 years despite all the hard work and overtime I put in over the previous year.   My company just held a meeting where the leadership was bragging about record growth... yeah...

At this point, I'm pretty sure I've got cancer, I'm being taken advantage of at my job, and I have nobody in my life to turn to.  I'm just tired.  No, I'm tired of being tired.  So, I slog through each day without hope.  I drag my feet to the doctor's appointments and zone out while they talk.  I had really given up.

Eventually, I had an operation to see what's going on.  Afterward, I'm diagnosed with a Hiatal Hernia in my stomach and Barrett's Esophagus disease.    I'M NOT DYING!  It still sucks, but man,  it was like a light switch in my brain.  It was like the realization that life wasn't over forced me to see the potential of what my life could be.

At the moment, I'm working on IT certs online and planning on moving to NYC soon (currently live in the Southwest US).  I know it's not a perfect place, but it was always my dream to live there.   I don't know where I'll live, or work, but for some reason, I just know I'll figure it out.  I know who I am and what I'm capable of.  I know how to treat people.   I know what I want.   I never took risks in life because I was always terrified of failure, of what could go wrong, and I just don't care about that anymore.  This year has taught me that we only have this one life and we can't waste it.

I have an awful lot of work ahead of me.  I'll have to really put myself out there to find the person I want to be with and to get the things I want out of life.   I'll be competing with people smarter, younger, and more accomplished than myself to establish the career I want.  Things will go wrong.  I will fail.  I will learn.

I'm ready.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. :)

&#x200B;

Edit: Good lord, I go eat dinner and come back to a ton of positive responses.  Thank you so much, everyone, it really means a lot!

Edit 2: Well, this post keeps blowing up and I couldn't be more touched.  My inbox is overflowing and I hope to respond to and read as many people's messages as I can over the next few days.  Also, I can't wait to update you guys within the next couple of months.Sometimes I see an interesting post and I think to myself: well, I can contribute to this conversation! Then I'll start typing my answer and just... decide it's too much work, erase everything and keep on lurking.

Maybe it's because English isn't my native language and it's harder for me to explain my opinion on more difficult or controversial topics. Or maybe I'm overthinking and judging my answer as not good/interesting enough. I really don't know!

Do you ever do it as well?

P.S. I see the irony, you people that are like me will just erase the answer halfway thereSo, I hope I can celebrate it with the friendlier part of Reddit. I've got a lot to achieve this year and I want your thoughts and prayers to help make this year a beautiful one. Thank you for coming to my small party..


Edit: I'm out of words. Thank you for making this such a memorable day and making me feel loved and cared. I love you all! (':Probably the first time in years that all of America, if just for a few hours, didn't argue about politics and beliefs, and just looked up at the sky with wonder and awe. I think that's just beautiful and worth noting.My super pregnant neighbour knocked on my door and said (paraphrasing) "can I have a bowl of whatever you're cooking, it smells nice and my pregnancy cravings are going crazy"

Damned right am I feeding this lady. She may have come over feeling awkward for asking, but if she thinks she'd  be leaving without a full plate and a tupperware container of my beef shin ragu she's got no idea how wrong she is.

I felt so proud and accomplished making something that someone had smelled and though "Well I need me some of that".

I told her that if there is anything that ever smells nice coming from my apartment, there is a plate for her no questions asked.

Cooking/baking has been my lockdown project, and that poor woman has no idea how much food is coming her way.

EDIT: Wow holy shit, I expected 3 messages asking what I was cooking not 500. Thanks for the awards and all.

A weird amount of messages asking why I'm lying for karma. My account is 3 years old and this is my first post, if If I liked lying for karma I'm pretty bad at it. Slow cook a ragu and trust me your place will smell like it for days, I don't know if its balls or desperation but think if I were pregnant and not just fat I'd feel pretty okay asking neighbours I've met before for whatever specific thing they were cooking.

For the redditors saying I should continue offering food once the baby is here, that sounds like a great idea, I think I'll slip a note on her door saying I'll make some extra portions for whenever she wants them.

Also, **RECIPE**:

Take your beef shin, (crust it) roll it around in course sea salt, cracked black pepper, and dried rosemary, let it sit in the crust for overnight in the fridge. Then take it out and sear it in butter until its browned on the outside and let rest for 30 mins, smother it in olive oil, and lightly cover in foil so steam can escape and roast at 180c for 2.5 hours.

Once it is done let it rest for 1 hour and get started on the sauce: Roast 3-4 vines of picollo tomatoes in salt and olive oil for 40mins. whilst that is cooking finely dice 1 large onion, 1 large carrot, and 2-3 sticks of celery.

Saute the carrot first, cover the pan so you sweat it then add the onion until it all looks soft, then add the celery and 5 crushed cloves of garlic and fry for about another 4 minutes until it all looks soft, then when the pan is still very hot throw in a glass of red wine to deglaze the pan. wait 1.5 mins for the alcohol to evaporate and add 500ml of rich beef stock mixed in with fresh rosemary.

Let it all bubble for a bit on mid heat then throw in your roasted tomatoes and break them up a bit with a wooden spoon, add FRESH basil and some dried oregano, if you can some fresh parsley too, a couple bayleaves and good splash or two of Worcestershire sauce. 

Move onto your beef and use two forks to shred the meat, dont cut it, shred it. then add it to your bubbling sauce.

I like to leave it on a very low simmer for about 2-3 hours until most of the water has been reduced off and you're left with a very thick and rich ragu that is worth the effort put into it.

For the pasta I suggest a fresh tagliatelle or pappardelle because the sauce is very rich and doesn't need pastas that will cling onto the sauce.

This recipe is for about 4-5 servings because its so easy to freeze and fuck going through this much effort every time you want a ragu for one.Everyone loves to have their phone out to capture every moment. People don't even get to experience the moment for themselves because they're watching it through their phone, or making sure everything is in frame the whole time. 

Just like nobody is going to watch your concert footage, nobody is going to watch your fireworks video. You're not even going to rewatch it. Leave your phone in your pocket, and enjoy the moment.My high school has 3 graduation periods (December, May, June). Most of my friends graduated in May, I did so in June so they weren't there (it's a boarding school so most people don't live in the city). The people just before me had really loud applause, I got scattered applause and a small group of my friends being obnoxiously loud and I was happy that they decided to be so loud.

When I started university I decided to be that obnoxious clapper to make the folks on stage feel good. I tried in the first December graduation but they didn't let me in. I tried again in ~~May~~ June and got in. Finessing your way into the ceremony in ~~May~~ June is super easy. It's so large that if you come 15 minutes late - wearing a suit and looking annoyed - nobody asks any questions, nobody checks your ticket, nothing. I switch seats regularly just to shake things up. I hate sitting still for the 3 hour ceremony but I think it makes them feel better so why not?

So far I've been to 4.

*Edit:* Wrong month. Not May, June.So I just saw my parents for the first time since Christmas this past week. My dad had a few friends over (his “quaranteam”) which consists of two neighbors. Older single guys. They apparently split cooking every weekend and do their social distancing in my dads man cave. Anyways last night when the friends were about to go home I hear a chorus of “I love you bro” “love you too man stay safe” “love you man make it home okay” and I started almost crying. How sweet is it that a bunch of 50-something men are able to express their love for each other and receive it in return. Anyways I’m sure as soon as the quarantine is over my dad will be kissing the homies goodnight. What an inspiration.... so, I took it to the managers office to hold on to it in case anyone came looking for it. They said no one has ever turned in cash before, everyone usually keeps it for themselves. So they took my number down and said if no one claimed it they would call me to come get it. I was super surprised by that because the thought of pocketing it never crossed my mind. (How terrible that people take things that aren’t theirs.) I also thought that was incredibly nice of the staff because they also could have kept it if no one claimed it. I really wanted the person who lost it to find it (I know that feeling, and it sucks). But it also crossed my mind that it would be nice if no one claimed it because $100 would be ridiculously helpful for me right now. 

Best part of the story: about 3 hours later I got a voicemail from the owner of the $100 (the hotel must have given it to them) thanking me for turning it in and a story about their situation and how much of a difference finding the $100 bill made.

Honestly, that voicemail was worth way more than $100 to me. Between the way the hotel staff handled the situation and the voicemail they left for me, it really restored a lot of faith in humanity.It's just come through! It's official! After such a long process, after so many roadblocks, false starts and bureaucracy, after meeting the most beautiful girl in the world and worrying ourselves sick everyday since that we wouldn't be able to be her fathers, it's happened. I can't believe it. 2019 has not been the easiest year but none of that matters now. My husband and I have our own family now and I'm so over the moon. Abby will be moving in permanently in early January but we will still get to spend Christmas with her, as well as having longer stays starting this weekend. I am just so over the moon and full of love right now.

Edit- thank so much for all the love and support in the comments! This sub is such a wonderful comunity and I'm glad I've been able to share some happiness with you all.These two guys were talking to me about me lifting weights and drinking protein shakes. One of them is obese which makes this even more... interesting. They said men don't want musuclar girls. I just said "Oh I'm not doing this for men, I'm doing this for myself". They immediately shut up.

I didn't raise my voice and kept my cool. That was an achievement for me. :) 

Girls, keep calm and lift on.

Edit:Thank you all for all the kind words! You guys gave me the boost I needed. I really really appreciate all the comments.

Edit 2: I know this is gonna be so cliche and pisses people of (Sorry) but thank you for the stranger who gave me platinum!I am not "new" to Reddit but, new to posting on here (just the last few months). I just want to do a damn snack exchange but need 600 Karma to post there!! I am not begging for karma here, I am legitimately asking HOW to do this??? I gift a lot of pizzas in random acts of pizza, I try to comment on threads I feel like I have something to add or say, but OMG it's been like 5 months and 17 gifted pizzas and still not to 600!!! Shit, I have even given 10 gold's to people! Please tell me the secret!!! I am desperately wanting to do a snack exchange :)Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for their kind words. On some of your recommendation I’m sending her a book about science experiments. She loves science and wants to be a scientist when she grows up.


I feel a bit guilty because I haven’t talked to her in quite a while. But she got ahold of mom’s phone and she called me. I’m almost 30 and she’s 6. And she’s so cute. First thing she asked me if I’d I still remember her. I told her of course I do because she’s one of my favorite people in the whole world. She asked if she could visit me. I had to tell her she lives far far away so she probably couldn’t tonight. She then asked if I was lonesome. I got a bit choked up because I really am. But I told her “only sometimes”. Now she wants to sent me her “science experiments” because she doesn’t want me to be lonely. Regardless of who you are or what your relationship is with your  parents I hope you all make time for your siblings. They can be the most precious things in your life.Someone goes through and down votes everything I post... And I love it. Every single thing I post, big or small, silly or insightful, gets seen by at least this person. No matter what I write, I have an audience. I'm not just posting to the void... I'm posting to you. 

Thank you

Edit: this karma probably more than makes up for the downvotesI know a lot of people get excited about their birthday but I just don’t see the big deal. It’s not anything I accomplished, it’s just the day I was born. I’m not trying to hate on anyone who does like to celebrate theirs. I mean my wife loves celebrating hers, mine, and our sons. I just never get excited about mine. Was just curious if any others felt the same?

Edit: first off, thanks for the birthday wishes everyone. 

This post wasn’t really to draw attention, it was more about my apathy towards my birthday. I woke up this morning and it just felt like any other day. So I thought why not see if others feel this way. I quickly realized that a lot of people do for a lot of different reasons. I also realized through reading many comments that I have a lot to be thankful for in having people that genuinely care about me not just on my birthday but everyday. I know not everyone has that and it’s not something to take for granted.

Next to the topic of my title. I know the saying is couldn’t care less and that I didn’t proofread the title and it’s says could. Even in saying they couldn’t care less they have to in so way care or they wouldn’t feel the need to express it. So in fact they have room to care less. So I think could care less is more appropriate. 

Thank you for the silver award too. It’s my first award. 

Lastly everyone that shares my birthday, I hope you have the happiest of days today. Everyone else happy belated/early birthday!

That is all.Now there's a Pandemic and their jobs are the ones that run the country and world. They are the ones who get our foods and basic needs up. You cannot make fun of them and look at it like a lowly job. Or feel that you're above especially when you're too much a coward to face the outside dangers of the virus.My friends said it couldn't be learned. I couldn't even lift one a little higher than the other, I was a failure to the highest degree.

For the next month, I raised my eye brows up and down,  5 sets of 45 seconds. I worked my way up and increased my reps.

Then I practiced raising my eyebrows, and slowly lowering one at a time. Vice versa (3x15 4 days a week)

Now I have achieved my goals, my friends were wrong, and also liars. It must sting knowing that I just contradicted their most fundamental beliefs. I was an underdog and now I'm a confident, vascular freak of nature.Pretty much what the title says. I was back from an evening session and I just went into the kitchen for something I didn't remember and while I was going back to my room I just casually asked her "Hey mom , are you fine ?". She put on the purest smile and she said " Yeah son , just making you your favorite dinner". I rarely ask her about her day because I'm a dumb idiot but today I was glad I did and hope I make this a daily thing :)

Edit - I'm just glad that this thread made a few people call their moms and that makes me so happy. Love y'all ❤️

Edit - I'm even more glad to know that all the mommas are appreciating this thread and us kids. Love y'all even more ❤️

Edit - Sorry , last one I promise but I don't wanna ignore the dads. They're awesome too ! Here's to loving them ❤️Working a slightly higher than minimum wage job in an expensive West Coast state, and saving money (especially during Covid) has been really tough. It took opening an online savings account and direct depositing a portion of my paycheck to it to do it. Not having easy, immediate access to it made it so much easier. I forget the account is there most of the time, and every time I check it, I get so happy that I am actually able to save, even if it is only a little at a time.I’ve had pain in my neck for as long as I could remember, Ive just lived with it for so long. I’ve tried EVERYTHING I could afford. Taking mild pain meds or anti-inflammatories. Vibrating massagers, heating pads, ice packs. All of it, but it never really did much for me. 

The other day I stopped at the dollar store for a few odds and ends, when at the checkout was this silly looking object. It’s called a face roller and it’s this little thing that kinda looks like a shrunken paint roller? It’s supposed to relax your face, and that’s what I got it for. It cost 95 cents, what did I have to lose? 

It worked alright on my face, loosened it a bit but nothing too crazy. Eventually I halfmindedly started rubbing it on my neck. 

And holy FUCKING CHRIST. I actually felt the knots and pain rolling away, I couldn’t believe it. I’m actually crying as I write this, I cannot believe my neck feels completely normal right now. I’m going to look online for a nice version of one of these things, because I couldn’t imagine what the non- 85 cent version is like. 

I don’t have anyone to tell this too, so just felt like bragging somewhere. I’m so unbelievably happy right now.

Edit: I just googled “face roller” and set it to shopping and it’s pretty much the only thing that shows up.I know that airports are traditionally hated by everyone for the constant rush and anxiety, but for me, I love them.  The feeling of sitting in a seat (especially at night) watching so much happen around me reminds me how small I am in relation to the rest of the world, and I love this feeling so much.  Does anyone else feel like this in airports?This probably has been said before but I feel like I need to reiterate it. The fact that alcohol is pushed into our faces by: making it a cultural norm to celebrate your first drink the day you turn legal age, having excessive amounts of pubs/bars in the middle of town, advertising liquor on magazines, billboards, bathrooms, etc., people bragging about how much they can drink and or talk about how cool it is to be blackout drunk and getting wAsTeD, it’s truly disgusting and I’m disappointed in society for it. I understand that alcohol can be controlled at a mature level but almost all adults cannot control their liquor which leads to alcoholism, family issues, damage to physical and mental health and so much more issues down the road. I’m not going to be on my high horse because I have admittedly drank too much plenty of times and or purposely went over my limit due to my poor drinking choices and the alcohol increases more poor choices. Anyways, I hate myself because it’s been only giving me negative outcomes, never positive. I just wish alcohol wasn’t a norm and it was more of a niche thing, as if it was something that people weren’t talking about how drunk they got on the weekend or how stupid they acted on alcohol.The edit you’ve all been waiting for at the bottom. 

I’ve been working as a technician in medical insurance for the last two years. In that amount of time I’ve out performed nearly everyone else. I finished my degree in Communication. I’ve won a handful of low level quality and candor awards. 

My annual review will be completed within the next six hours. Then I will know if I get a raise, a bonus, and other privileges. 60% of technicians fall into the 3/5 point range which is considered where most techs are supposed to be. I told my manager last year I wanted to get a 5 and he told me how hard it was. 

4/5 points: 30% of technicians obtain. 
5/5 points: 2% of technicians obtain. 

Two weeks ago he said he is going to fight to get me a 5/5 rating. 

If I get this my bonus will be larger than the amount of credit card debt I’m in. My raise will be enough for me to afford a car finally. 

I would like some good vibes. I’m jumping out of my skin. I don’t want to depend on this money but I really am. This year has financially killed me I’m clawing my way back up but just can’t afford to pay everything off as fast as I need to.

Edit: I’m overwhelmed with support I’m so grateful for all of you! I’m still waiting but bet that I’ll post an update once I know!

Edit 2: meeting got pushed back to 4 CST. If you think you’re bristling with anticipation imagine how I feel!!!

Edit 3: guys it’s only 3:15 CST I don’t know yet and I’m even more anxious! Thank you for all the good you’ve sent my way I’ve still got a bit to go but I will know in about 45 minutes to an hour!

Edit 4: 
Guys I’m crying as I write this. The fact that thousands of people from all over the world took time in their day to give me words of encouragement and support is so amazing. Thank you all. 

So the reason my supervisor pushed my meeting back so far in the day is because his manager tabled the conversation on me. 

My supervisor compiled every kudos, compliment, certificate, award, training document, and project I have worked on this year. His manager wanted to take the time to look through all of what he had so she paused on me and they addressed my other team members first. 

He fought for 45 minutes giving every reason he possibly could to give me all 5 points. His manager was hesitant. They’d only awarded 3 other techs this year so far because of the strict criteria and her guidelines for how to award points. 

He pressed her, pleaded my case, and showed all of the documentation he possibly could to prove I deserved to the rating. And I am so thankful for all that he did. 

But despite all of the efforts he made I still got the news that nearly killed me. 

Now that I’ve given you all the same heart attack that he gave me I GOT THE RATING. 

I AM ONE OF FOUR TECHNICIANS. 

Less than 1% of technicians were awarded all 5 points and I’m one of them! New car and no debt coming this January.

Edit 5: you all are amazing. To answer some FAQ: 

1. I plan on buying a used car, I have owned 2 cars in the past and they were both 5 years or older and used. 

2. A medical insurance technician processes insurance claims made by patients (I have no control whether the company covers things or not so please don’t blame the tiny screw in the giant cog of fucked up healthcare) 

3. I am going to pay off all of my credit card debt first. If the remainder of my bonus is enough for a down payment then yes I’m getting a car I need/want ASAP but if not then I’ll be saving the remainder. 

4. I do have a 401k and a retirement plan with Edward Jones.I had two dreams this month where I was deeply in love with a girl. In the first dream, it was some girl I’ve never met in real life. In the second dream, I was going out with this girl that I really like in school. Inside the dreams, I just felt extremely happy and content to have been with someone... to have loved someone and to have someone love you back. But when the dream was over I was extremely upset to realize that the dream wasn’t real. And now I’m hoping that I get a dream like that again.I don't know why I'm posting this here but I just want to share my reddit love story because I just married the kindest, most supportive person I've ever met and I owe it all to reddit.

Just over 4 years ago, in June 2016, I drunkenly posted on r4r while I was on a night out with some work colleagues. They are all very beautiful and I guess I felt a bit rubbish and I just wanted some attention. I had a lot of replies and spoke to a few people over the next couple of days. This one guy stood out because his opening message was unusual; it involved calling his cat a bastard and made me laugh.

We spoke every day for a month. We sort of bonded over having both ended serious relationships very recently. I never expected it to go anywhere. When he invited me to visit at the end of July, I thought it would just be a fun trip and had no reason not to. I drove 150 miles across the country to meet him. I figured I could just come home again if he was creepy.

He wasn't creepy and we had a good time in a small little bar drinking cocktails. It really took me by surprise when later that night he kissed me. I ended up staying the whole weekend.

For the next year we alternated visiting each other almost every weekend. And then we made the decision that I would move in with him so I got a new job in his town and moved there with my dog in August 2017. His family are wonderful and seemed to just love and accept me from the day they met me.

I've never felt so supported and cared for. He accepts all of my flaws and has helped me enormously. I've always struggled with my mental health and while this is still an ongoing battle, his support never wavers. He puts up with an awful lot and never complains.

In December 2018 we had a baby boy. He is just the best thing. I don't know how I got so lucky to have the most fantastically chilled out, happy little boy. I can't imagine ever being able to choose someone better to bring my son up with. He is just the best dad and I love nothing more than watching them together.

And finally on 1st August 2020 I married this redditor. I want always to remember how lucky and loved I felt that day.

If you read this far, thank you. I just wanted to put this out there so I can always come back and read it when i need to remember to be grateful for my life.


ETA: I'm really overwhelmed by all your encouraging and kind messages! I posted this quite late last night and stayed up until 1am responding to as many of you as I could, but I've woken up to so many more comments than I could have imagined so I'm sorry if I didn't respond to you directly! The response has mostly been lovely and I'm so glad our story has made so many other redditors smile or given them hope. 

To answer a few common questions:

No, 150 miles isn't considered far by most Americans. I know this from the posts I see about people travelling a couple of hours for a party and whatever. Your country is much bigger than mine, which is England, for those wondering. I'm from the West of England, very close to Wales, and we now live in the east. The journey would take about 2 and a half hours on a good day if timed right, but more often between 3 and 4 and sometimes 5 hours with bad traffic on the motorway.

The cat and the dog never met. He owned the cat with his ex and she wanted the cat. I think it lives with a family member of hers now. I feel bad about that but there was no alternative for my dog, and he is my first love anyway. No way I would have left him with anyone else.

We had seen pictures of each other so I knew what he looked like. His was a pretty bad picture so I was pleasantly surprised. I was probably a disappointment when I turned up not looking as good as a picture I probably spent hours finding a good angle for. :)

I'm sorry some of you feel I am 'cheap' for staying the whole weekend when we first met. I would add this is someone I had spent hours and hours talking to for an entire month though, but even if this wasn't the case, I'd say it worked out pretty well. Mostly I just wanted to finish binge watching the first series of Stranger Things to be honest.

Yes, this is a bit cringe. It's quite unlike me.

Edit 2: I just want to say that there are some brilliant people over on r/r4r who really deserve a chance. There are some really high effort posts on there, highlighting how funny and interesting people are. Mine was just some rubbishy 'Ha I'm drunk talk to me' type thing and I got lucky, in no small part because I am a girl, I think. So if you're thinking about joining up, remember there is a real human behind those messages and be kind. Good luck!I’m kinda sad... I really like this present. I’m 21 years old, I understand how it sounds childish but he actually knew I wanted them for a long time and surprised me with them, we immediately went outside to try them and we had a lot of fun seeing my ass fall on the ground multiple times. 

It completely ruined it once I brought them home and my mom told me we “ live in a different reality” like if presents where supposed to always be something we need. She never gave me anything I really wanted, only stuff I needed, like socks or materials for classes. I don’t understand why silly things that simply make us happy are a bad present. I don’t wanna let her ruin it, please tell me I’m not the crazy one.

———————-——————

Ps: she’s not a bad mom, shes actually doing an effort be happy for me and see me break my ass too. Her comment only hurt me because it’s not a usual thing for her to say. We are a struggling family and her reaction is a bit understandable. Please don’t call her bad names! I still love my mom a lot. My dad on the other hand... lmao he’s the real bitch you guys should be calling names haha

Edit: I’m overwhelmed by your comments, I wanted to say thank you and I feel a lot better. I’m reading and replying to every single comment I can but I’ll have to go to bed soon, I just wanted to let you know that I’ll read them regardless. Thank you so much!!!

Edit 2: my boyfriend has Reddit, I’m not telling him about the post, I wanna see if it shows up on his popular page haha if you’re him reading this then hello there sir 👋 heheheLet's not mince words, this lady is ugly. Over 25+ years of treatment resistant acne, an androgynous face, and constant scowling will do that to you. I look at my childhood pictures and wonder what the heck happened. 


I try not to get upset about being mistaken for a man, I didn't choose my face or build after all, but it is a little depressing sometimes. 


Anyway, a few days ago a cashier asked me "How's it going, brother?" At first I was a little bummed out. Aww, man. Not again. But after thinking about it for a bit, I realized he was just being friendly. A small gesture to be pleasant. He didn't know I am a woman. He wasn't trying to insult me. After that it was better. It sort of felt like when an older southern black lady calls you "honey" or "honeychild" or when an abuelita calls you "mama" or the jacked gymdude calls you "bro" or the guys working on your house say "Thanks, Chief" after you bring them some cold drinks. Just humans being humans at each other. But in a nice way. Small things.I saw a post I liked, and decided to just purchase a bundle to give the person an award. 

I awarded it Silver, and oh my. 

Not long after, the dude/dudette send me a message  saying "Only silver? Give me gold bitch!". 

I knew Silver wouldn't do anything other than showing the award, but I thought any award would be somewhat appreciated. 
At least I would be, but I'm also a type of person that becomes completely ecstatic everytime someone either compliments me or smile at me. 

So yeah. 

Don't really know where to go from here.


(And this is where my excessive Edits begin, and yes, it has been posted at awardspeechedit.)

- Edit: Aww, whoever awarded this, you are so sweet! Thank you!
I wish I could award you back, so feel free to comment, Egg!

- Edit again: And Jacob!

- Edit again again: 
Okay, it hindsight it vaguely seems like I made this post to "farm awards" (just learned about that term), and it genuinely wasn't the intention, so I'm trying to re-award the very kind folks who awarded the post or comments. And thank you!

- Edit Nr. 72: This thread has become the most wholesome thing I have ever seen. 

I keep getting PMs from people letting me know that they are in a tough period in their lives, having trouble with upcoming final exams, and just a general feeling of sadness in these Corona virus times.

I'm always (and I mean ALWAYS) here to talk, and to listen. So if you feel like wanting to get something off your chest, you are always more than welcome to message me. 
I'm here, and I will keep trying to spread as much joy as I can. 

Keep on keeping on!

 UPDATE: 
I have now spend the 3.200 points that suddenly landed in my lap today, on awards to many of you. Points are still coming in, and I will keep spending them on you guys, until the counter replenishes. 
- 2 hours later: It's now at 6.600 points again, and my goal still stands. 
Thank you to the extreamly generous person who awarded Argentinium, I will make sure to pay it forward to as many people as possible. 

I love seeing your sweet messages and comments, and my goal is to someday have every single comment on this thread have the "Hygge" award, and have this be the official Hygge and Wholesomeness thread 😊. 

My original offer of PMing me if you need someone to talk to, still stands

- serious FINAL UPDATE: -
I have made a new subreddit for all of you.
 It's r/WholesomeHygge. 
It's my first community ever, so I hope I'm doing it right. I made it on a whim, and I have no idea if people want it. 

The idea is to keep this wholesome vibe going (please don't award it, the ones here are quite enough, and thank you again!), and make it a place where everyone is important, and everyone can get a virtual hug when needed. 
I will keep giving out awards here, and at WholesomeHygge, so head over and start Hygging!i used to go late to school EVERYDAY and my teachers would ask why everyday and my mom made me say  “i woke up late” to them EVERY DAY. 

now that i’m thinking about it i NEVER woke up late... it just took my mom A LONG time to stop yelling at us and actually get dressed herself, she would take her time. 

i remember crying everyday bc i hated being late and would even wake up early but i swearrrr my mom would purposely take her time... sometimes we were IN the car and she would stop driving just to yell at us..

so all those teachers thought i’m just lazy and always wake up late :(

Edit: damn this kinda made noise... I wasn’t expecting that... thank u for all the kind words... this was mostly a rant pls don’t worry too muchWhen I was 11 or 12 I was working witj my uncle to gut an old building. While driving a maul through a lathe and plaster wall I went deeper than intended and speared my pinky knuckle on a peice of old dirty wood. I pulled the wood out and continued working, thinking nothing of it.

After it healed I noticed a greyish black dot there. I showed it to my mom and she said some dirt must have been left behind.

I'm 36 now, for the last 25 or so years I've jokingly referred to my litte black knuckle dot as "my first tattoo".

This morning I was making shelves out of scrap plywood and cut myself a little bit in the same place. While checking the cut I noticed a darker dot deeper. I grabbed a knife and cut a bit deeper, eventually pulling out a ~1mm bit of what is presumably wood.

I'm a bit relieved to have it out, but a bit sad to have removed something that was a constant part of me for 2/3 of my life.

My wife is completely unimpressed.

EDIT: My uncle just texted me back, the house was built in 1901. The rest of the wood in that wall ended up in the burn pile, but that 1 mm bit completed its century in my hand.

EDIT 2: WOW. This is my most popular post ever! Thank you all for the wonderful conversations. It was interesting hearing about so many people's similar spots, and finding out about r/pencilstabbers (even one on someone's eye!), hearing about other scars like the lawnmower foot, and dozens of glass shards.

I'm off to read some Stormlight Archive for a few hours before bed. Have a good night everyone.

My wife is much more impressed with ~9000 upvotes than she is for a 120 yr old peice of wood embedded in my hand.

EDIT 3: I woke up to find that it ha blown up more! Wow. Also discovered that in addition to a lot of people being stabbed by pencils, and having thorns or glass embedded in them, there are A LOT of Sanderson fans here!

I'm on my 4th read through of the series, and still picking out odd easter eggs I missed. Hopefully those books get made into a movie so more people can experience it, I'd pit the Cosmere against GoT or LotR any day of the week. It and Malazan are my two favorite series.

EDIT 4: I just finished catching up on all the posts and awards from overnight. If you gave an award and didn't get a thank you it is because reddit was trying to get me to start a chat with you. I don't know your timezone and worried about waking you, so a big Thank You!

EDIT 5: I've never had a post blow up like this before, it has been an interesting experience. There have been so many interesting and very wholesome comments and discussions with almost no negativity. Thank you all! This has been an awesome day, regardless of if I get a tattoo dot to memorialize my splinter this thread and all of you are a better memorial to it than I could ever conceive.And I'm just so proud of her. Every single caller got off the line feeling better and every single one cracked a smile on their call. She's an angel and I'm so blessed to have her on my life.And he said, “Yeah, that makes sense. You probably don’t want it to break. That’s cool man, I’m jealous.”

The dude indulged my completely absurd lie just to be nice and avoid making me feel bad.

What a hero.That's right, this post? Right here? I'mma about to appreciate boys on it. Had you seen one? Had you seen how cute those motherfuckers are? I bet you did, because if you are here, you are like me and love seeing guys doing average normal things.

Like when then put their hands on their pockets, damn I love when they do that. Or when they do that thing with the hair, when they run their fingers through their hair? Hell yeah that's awesome. And when they take theirs shirt off in that unique guy way? Damn, my heart almost makes the Slipknot drummer look like the keyboard cat. I love how simple and practical they are.

Chubby boys, skinny boys, buff boys, tall boys, short boys, white boys, black boys, asian boys, trans boys you name it, they are all cute in their own ways. If you are reading this and you are a boy, you better feel appreciated, because you, my dude you are handsome.

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Edit: I wanna thanks everyone for the comments and messages it's been really sweet, unfortunately I have to sleep but I will keep reading them tomorrow, even if this take me the entire day.

Edit²: This post keeps getting bigger and bigger, and I'm really glad for it. I'll keep reading the comments and the messages through the day. I don't know if it will eventually become so big that I won't be able, but I'll keep trying.

Final Edit: So far I think I was able to read all the comments. Unfortunately, I have a pretty shitty data plan, and won't be able to continue. But I want to say that it's been a emotional rollercoaster reading through it. 

Overall, I'm really happy and truly glad for all the messages I've got. I hope I was able to answer every single one of them until now. And for the ones that will come, I'll keep answering them when I have the chance.

Thanks for the dudes, and also for the girls who shared their opinions about all those beautiful boys.

I hope you all had a great day.
I wish you all a great year, and a great life.
Be well, every single one of you.I’ve always had my fair share of dumb things I’ve said or asked but last weekend me and some friends played are you smarter than a fifth grader. During the game, I realized I really don’t know basic knowledge. Luckily my friends didn’t make me feel bad about it and we all laughed it off, but I just couldn’t stop thinking about it all week, especially since I only graduated high school two years ago. 

But tonight, as I lie fully awake at 5am, I’ve come to the conclusion that as long as im kind, that its okay if I’m not the brightest. I pick up garbage I find outside, I put other peoples shopping carts away when they leave them around the parking lot, I go for a bike ride around my town everyday to check up and chat with a few seniors, I love to bake treats every week for my coworkers and my friends, and I love love love giving people compliments (I’m a cashier so this is really easy when I get to talk to like 100 people a day.) And I don’t mean to try sit here and brag or try make it seem like I’m better than anyone but I just really love knowing that sure, maybe I’m not the smartest but at least my heart is in the right place.

~
Edit: would like to just add that it isn’t just the trivia game, i didn’t have the easiest time in high school (I was definitely more of a theatre and concert band type of gal) and I also dropped out of uni a year ago after failing every class so that brought me down a lot of pegs. And honestly Just hearing “you’re dumb but at least you’re cute” too many times for my old roommate kinda messed with my brain a little hah

Edit again: wow! Thank you so much for my first awards! I just stumbled upon this subreddit a couple hours ago and didn’t imagine getting this many responses. I’m trying to read all of them and respond to most but I really do appreciate all of them :)I have 4 boys ranging from ages 3 to 14. Tonight the 3 year old was very tired, which of course makes him resistant to bedtime. As I was carrying him past my oldest's door (which is perpetually closed) he asked to see his big brother. I knocked and asked my oldest if he would talk to his baby brother. This aloof, too cool for everything teenager got up and held his baby brother and comforted him, rocking and talking to him until he was calm enough to accept his own bed. In a house, normally full of chaos and bickering, I saw in this small gesture that there is real love between these brothers despite the significant age gap.I got booted in a Jimmy John's parking lot a few months ago. Well, it was the parking lot of a stip mall where you could park about 12 feet from Jimmy John's But the catch is, technically it's not the JJ's property. So the strip mall property owner hires one of those shady boot-n-tow vehicle impounding businesses to circle the lot like sharks and boot anyone who parks there and enters any establishment not technically part of the strip mall. 

Which was me, back in like august. 

I picked up a sandwich (freaky fast) and got back to my motorcycle in about 4 minutes, and that asshole had booted me. I was so confused, but he explained that JJ's parking is in an adjacent lot, and this lot was only for the strip mall customers.

I offered to buy a smoothie or something at the strip mall, so I would qualify as one of their customers, but he said it was too late. He saw me walk into JJ's and now I must pay the $80.00 fee to remove the boot. 

After about an hour of HEATED argument, I had no choice. I paid the guy. $92 lunch. $12 for the sandwich and chips, and $80 for 4 minutes of parking. Motorcycle parking, no less, which takes up basically zero valuable space. 

Anyway since then I've done some research and it turns out that's extortion which is illegal. By law, they are required to remove the boot and mail you the bill if you are not able to pay them on the spot. You know why? Because it's not illegal to NOT HAVE 80 DOLLARS. And what would I do if I got that bill in the mail? Idk, maybe I'd pay it. Or maybe I'd set it ablaze and use it to light a fat spliff because FUCK YOU DON'T STEAL MY MONEY. Parking extortionists aren't the law. I'm not paying them a dime. 

So anyway I saw them out booting again at lunch hour, so I figured I'd have a fun time with it. I parked in the JJ's lot, got a hoagie, and walked to the shark lot and waited for people to come out to their booted cars. Then, I interrupted the parking enforcement's whole speech by citing the law which mandates that they unboot the car without payment. 

The parking lot guy was livid. And there was nothing he could do about it. Just like how I was livid and there was nothing I could do about it when he booted me back in August. Fuck that business. Fuck that dopey boot guy and his shitty job and his shitty life. I laughed my ass off at him all afternoon.I added this girl on Snapchat and we never really talked but we have mutual friends. I had noticed she had very pretty teeth (I aspire to be an orthodontist) and on one of her stories I complimented her smile. Almost immediately she replied with a response of her smiling from ear to ear, and she thanked me for the compliment. She hadn’t posted herself showing her teeth often when she smiled. 

Now whenever I see her post a new picture of herself, she smiles with her teeth showing, and her beautiful smile reminds me of our little encounter and it warms my heart.I remember being a little kid and just spending hours looking at my map, letting my imagination run free. That's how I became interested in geography and learned a lot about the world. 

I don't know of many parents who put maps on their kids' rooms, but I definitely think it's an excellent idea to promote education in a fun way!I am in my lovely 2014 Kia Forte and I pull up to a red light to turn left. My windows are down. A truck pulls up on my right side. I hear someone yell "hey". So I look over and there are these 2 middle aged maybe older white dudes. The guy driving, said "sorry ma'am, just wanted to let you know you left your key in the door". I say, "oh my gosh, thank you so much".Then I reach out my window and touch my door. They erupt in laughter  as I realize my key is in the ignition and they speed off into the sun laughing like hyenas.

Edit: after the fact, I don't feel so stupid lol. It was harmless fun and actually made my day :)I’m nervous as fuck. I just needed to let it out. We’re keeping it a secret for now and haven’t told anyone. We want to have a big ceremony and celebrate with everyone but COVID. We just decided to do it and made the appointment to go to the courthouse. He told me that later we can do a big wedding in Mexico and that he would do it as big as I wanted it. He’s so sweet I love him so much. I can already see my future with this man. We want the same things and I can feel how much he loves me. Well anyway the clock is ticking and ahh my heart is ready to come out of my chest. Okay, wish me luck!Feels bad man.

I mean, I get it: they want a profit. But honestly with the way YouTube Premium is going (or rather not going), all they’ve done is slash the utility of their app without getting that much in return.

It’s just disappointing is all.

Edit: Perhaps I gave the wrong impression. No, I’m not one of those chumps who actually pays for YouTube, and I never will.

Edit: I am on iOS, not Android, as are a lot of the other people viewing this thread. We all definitely appreciate any solutions or ideas that you provide, but it would also be good to note whether the solutions you propose only work on one or the other.

Edit: 400 other people have already suggested YouTube Vanced. Pls no more. It is Android only, btw.

Edit: I used music just as an example. YT isn’t my primary source for music. I get my music from my streaming service of choice, as do most of y’all I bet. But there are also plenty of other reasons why you wouldn’t need the visual content of a video. Podcasts, Ted talks, whatever else.

Edit: Been busy the last two days. Haven’t had time to read or reply to many comments. I’m back to the party a bit late, but I’ll be replying to some of y’all soon.So, I live in China. Before the COVID thing, in January, my employer gave us a huge amount of groceries (like nuts, oil, rice) for spring festival.

But I live in a tiny ass apartment without a kitchen, ALONE. So I really don’t need that much food, and I genuinely CANT eat all of them since I’m also a tiny human being. 

Before leaving work that day, I think long and hard about what I should do with all these food. There’s no food banks where I live and I don’t even have a car. Most of my friends are already travelling back home, so I can’t just split them with my friends.

Then, I realized that, there’s a tiny noodle place close to where I work. They’re obviously a family-run business, I sometimes go there for dinner. Not familiar with the owner (never even talked to that guy), but I thought, hey, they need oil and stuff more than I do.

So, I just went to their place, they were just closing up. There’s no customer. I grabbed the guy cleaning tables, asking if they want the groceries I’m holding. He looked confused and suspicious of me, went in and got the owner to talk to me.

The owner is actually a very nice older chubby dude. I asked him if he wants my stuff. He mistook my intention and asked how much I want for them. I blushed so hard and stuttered that they were all free. He just went “no no no, I can’t do that, you must have some money.” (He’s Uyghur, so he’s not very good at speaking mandarin).

Me with my red ass face insisted that he keep the groceries for free while he tries SO HARD to give me money. I said:”Happy new year, it’s for you.” And I basically ran out of there yelling HAPPY NEW YEAR.

And the COVID thing happened, I met the dude a few days ago after things eased a bit here in China. He was just closing up, again, and he gave me the biggest smile I’ve ever seen.

Happiest day in three months.He was just so prideful in his work, in the task at hand, his positivity was infectious. 

It would be so easy, almost expected, to not give a what about his job. Instead he went the complete opposite direction.

Edit to update: Found out his name is Jerry. I’ve reached out to both the local management as well as the corporate offices (Choice Hotels) with a similar message. Still awaiting responses from both, I will update as soon as I hear back. 

Hopefully we can get Jerry a raise!! You guys are awesome and this thread has been so full of positive stories. Today was a good day.  Thanks for that Jerry. 

Also, the hotel was in Winslow Arizona, don’t see any harm in disclosing that info. And the place was a Quality Inn, not a Comfort Inn. Cheers.

Edit 2: here is The response from corporate:

I still need more solid proof Jerry is gonna get his, but this is a solid start. Still no response from the local mgmt.He's adorable! He never ever bakes, and rarely cooks. I am a fairly intermediate baker who's pumped out at least 10 recipes during quarantine. Today, I think purely out of boredom, my sweet husband exclaimed with a big smile, "those bananas have turned, I think I'm going to bake banana bread by myself!". So he texted back and forth with his dad (a master banana bread maker) and got a recipe lined up and away he went. I'm outside laying in the sun right now, and he's been popping out every couple minutes to ask where things are or if he should substitute this for that or if he should cut the sugar down... I'm just tickled by the whole thing, I think he's adorable for trying something new and out of his comfort zone. And even more tickled he sees me as some sort of baking expert lol. I love him and he's the cutest.

** *UPDATE!* The hubs came out with his beautiful looking bread fresh out of the oven, it rose perfectly and smells absolutely amazing. I told him to put it on the wire rack to cool. He went back inside to do so, and then popped his head out one last time and said, "I DID IT!" in the cutest voice hahaha. Having a proud mom moment.. even though I'm his wife.

** *UPDATE #2!* We're eating it and it's perfect! He knocked it out of the park. [Bread tax](https://imgur.com/a/MJIRIqI)

** UPDATE #3!* Here is the recipe my husband used that his dad passed along to him https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-banana-nut-bread-4584069. It's not my FIL's recipe, just the one he's been using lately! Cheers and happy baking!I can’t tell you how awesome it was! They splashed him, called him by his name, and didn’t run away when he did his “dance.” You’d have to see it but when he’s happy he does this jumping motion like a little dance. His happiest sound is like Fonzies’s “AYYY” on repeat. They asked me lots of questions about him and listened to my answers. I explained that his brain works differently than theirs. They were so undaunted and didn’t act uncomfortable or afraid (a lot of kids do.) He doesn’t have any friends and that’s ok. I just don’t want kids to actively shun him. He has fun splashing too! They’ll never know how they warmed my heart, but now you do! Wherever they are now, I hope they’ll remember what they were told today and I hope they never change.

EDIT: Oh wow! I’ve seen so many people say it before but now it’s my turn... I went to sleep and this blew up! I am so shocked and gratified that our happy little moment made so many strangers smile!! I’m going to try and respond to each comment over time, you guys really surprised me here with all the love ❤️So I work as an independent contractor cleaning a music lessons facility. I go in on weekends or after hours and clean the place up. Sometimes I notice things that are off: a weird smell, water where it shouldn't be, that kind of thing.

I had thought maybe I was being paranoid and he didn't want to be texted on weekends or nights with this stuff. I always fretted over the decision to "bother" him even though he's super nice and would never complain.

Apparently on 4 separate occasions, the things I noticed would have become huge financial problems if I hadn't texted my employer when I did. Just this weekend I noticed a musty smell in one room that turned out to be a busted A/C unit in the ceiling. The studio is closed for Thanksgiving this week and that sucker would have been leaking water for 9-10 days before anyone else was even there. 

It's a small thing, but with my MASSIVE social anxiety, it's really meaningful to find out something that I thought was annoying is actually an asset that saved someone's butt. No one who knows me would get how huge this is for me. Just felt the need to share.My phone rang and it was a number I didn't know but local to me. I never answer calls from unknown numbers but for some reason tonight I did. After I said "hello" a small voice asked for a person I have never heard of. I told her she had the wrong number and she burst in to tears. I asked if she was alright and she said she had had a horrible day that included testing positive for Covid. She said that was extra bad because it robbed her of the very little human contact she had. She was trying to reach a friend she hadn't see in a while just to have someone to talk to. We talked for almost half an hour about everything and nothing. I asked if she was prepared for the major winter storm that is due to hit our area tomorrow. She said she had planned to shop this afternoon but then received word that she was Covid positive. She is an older widow and lacks the confidence with technology to order grocery delivery. I offered to drop a box at her house if she was okay giving me her address. I will bring her what she needs early in the morning before the weather hits. We ended our conversation with a plan to stay in touch at least until she is able to go out again. 

Here is the thing, I know it might seem that I am doing a favor for her but I think I need this more than her. I have been in a funk lately, feeling useless and insignificant. I needed the chance to matter to someone, to make someone smile and she gave me that entirely by accident. I can not wait to talk to her again.

EDIT: Guys, I am blown away. Your response to this has me damn near in tears. I took my new friend a bunch of groceries and some coffee & donuts this morning. She was standing in her doorway waiting. I stood on the porch & talked with her through the glass for a bit. It was so nice to see & speak to her. She was worried about her sidewalk being clears of snow for the mailman so I made a Facebook post for her and a young man volunteered to come do it for her! Yay!

EDIT 2: You guys are blowing me away with the response to this. I am speechless. I feel like I should share this love with my new friend so I am going to find a way for her to see some of this. As a few commenters suggested, I encourage you all to reach out to local nursing homes or even an elderly neighbor amd offer a smile.Because their best friends have better best friends or because they don't bond enough with people to have best friends or because their best friends constantly come and go and it just kinda leaves them felling vaguely isolated even though they might have plenty of regular friends.
                                                                          Edit- If anyone wanna be my friend or has something to say feel free to DM.I’m 50. I got married today. 

I’ve never been married. I was feeling a bit bummed out because I wasn’t getting a “real” wedding. 

We got married via a Zoom meeting with a City Hall judge. I wasn’t expecting much. 

Well, it was great! There were 20-some other couples. 

Some were dressed in wedding attire, some in t-shirts. 

Some were in their bedrooms, some were in their living rooms, some were outside. 

Some were very, very young, some were old. 

There were white people, brown people, Black people, Americans, people from other countries, straight people, gay people. 

And there was so much love. 

The judge had us all unmute our Zoom at the end of each ceremony to cheer the other couples. He urged us to stay logged on even after our own ceremonies so everyone would get cheered. 

It was so diverse and so fun and it generated such a sense of community. And I got to marry the sweetest, kindest, most patient man I’ve ever known in my life. 

What a great day. Thanks for reading.It’s a nice way to turn a year older in this weird year; hadn’t really planned on anything but hey, I can show myself a nice time and enjoy the occasion. 

Have you celebrated a birthday these past few months? What did you get up to?

Edit: wow, this comment section is so wholesome! Thanks to everyone for all the birthday wishes, and happy birthday to anyone who either had it recently, today or will have it soon! In any case, take care of yourselves :DI know it seems minor, but I had some really messed up things happen in my home life before quarantine so I’m spending it living in total isolation instead of living with my best friend. I’ve been incredibly depressed, barely even leaving my bed. My hair was starting to become dreadlocks from not brushing it. I finally got myself up and cleaned myself and brushed my hair and showered and I feel 100x better. Don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I’m proud of myself

EDIT: I totally did not expect this post to get the response that it did. I guess a lot of us are struggling with self care during this global crisis. It’s nice to know I’m not alone, and the outpouring of love and kindness from you all is so incredibly encouraging that I managed to pick myself up and wash and fold two loads of laundry too lol. I’m planning on going through and responding to all the comments later but there are a lot! Just know I appreciate every single kind word and extend my support and love back out to you all. We can get through this together, one day at a time ❤️A week ago I bought myself a brand new skateboard and stood on it for the very first time in my life. It was love at first sight.

Today, after god knows how many sweaty hours of practise and hits taken to the shins, I did it. I landed my very first (and very basic) trick. There's no stopping me now.This was just so cute. I vented because I feel just dreadful, and a bunch of guys started asking questions like "do you have a heating pad?" "Have you ever tried midol?" "Have you talked to your doctor about birth control options?" "Maybe some tea would help?"

Like where did you learn all of that? The men in my life don't know that. My dad thought my period was some sort of horrible infection, one of my friends reached into my bad and screamed when he touched a tampon, and my bf is supportive but im pretty sure he just knows my period is the sleepy crying time 😭 it Added some sweetness to an otherwise painful and terrible day.

Oh and one more thing. Not a single surprise dick pic. Not one 🥰

Edit: Ended up seeing my own post get spread online. I apologize to anyone I may have hurt.Bad posture can lead to but is not limited to, back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain, rounded shoulders, and headaches. 

Don’t be another statistic.My sister had a serious car crash in 2019 and was put in a coma. Only last friday, she woke. We had a party to celebrate it, however she still needs to rest constantly and take medication. Her arms have healed pretty well, but she has small scars near her wrists.

Thanks for reading and have a nice day! Please ask any questions! :)


Edit: Thankyou so much everyone for the support and the 2 awards! TWO! My sister and I have been reading all of your comments!Sitting in my car, is a place where I cry, think and decompress. 

My car has seen me cry more than my own mother! 

It’s my only escape from everyone and everything!


Edit: thank you all for the kind comments! I wasn’t expecting this post to blow up! I didn’t even think a lot of people would relate, oh how I was wrong! 

Our cars is certainly the safe place for everything! 

Stay strong , & safe!

❤️The title basically says it all, but I was driving to the store today. On my way, I pulled out into traffic and completely mis-judged how close an oncoming car was. It wasn’t dangerous or anything, but the car was definitely close enough that the person had to slow down a lot because of my stupid move. 

They honked, flicked me off, etc. We ended up pulling into the same parking lot I was going to. To make matters worse, we both got out of our cars at pretty much exactly the same time. The guy came up to me and wasn’t yelling, but was obviously annoyed and started telling me how I cut him off and how I’m a fucking idiot. 

To be fair, he was right. I didn’t mean to cut him off, but I definitely did. 

I said that I was super sorry and that I mis-judged traffic big time. I told him that I hate it when people cut me off in traffic and that I was definitely wrong. 

He looked kind of shocked. Then, he said, “Dude, I’m sorry I was being a dick.” And, no joke. The dude went in to hug me. We did that awkward stranger hug (with our masks on, obviously) and he told me to have an awesome day. We went our separate ways and that was it. 

I just thought it was kind of a cool moment. And, just a reminder for all of us that not every situation has to be terrible. Sometimes we can just treat each other well and see what happens.It's literally in every single one of your shows that I've ever seen. It's worn out, and doesn't add anything. If a character says something funny, the audience should recognise this and laugh themselves, not be told when to laugh by some basic laugh track.

I can't think of a single UK show that has a laugh track, and they're all great shows. Take Little Britain, it doesn't need them, but the US version has them. It's just pointless.

Sincerely, someone from the UK.

Edit: HOLY MOLY! I went to sleep and now this! Thank you so much kind stranger for the Gold, first award ever in 90k karma!We went to dinner and then made out in my car for an hour while listening to music like a couple of teenagers. We’ve been courting via text for weeks and went on a hike, but tonight was our first kiss. 

Since my kids’ mom abandoned us in 2003 I’ve just settled for whatever came my way because I didn’t think I should go after someone I actually wanted to be with, because it would just end up like it did with her. But a few months ago I decided to set and hold an unattainable standard and settle for nothing less, at least in terms of what attracted me to a woman and her personality. This woman fits it and I went for it despite my social ineptitude and complete lack of confidence.The higher ups decided my position was not necessary, so I got cut. I’m pretty terrified, but trying to stay positive. Humour is a coping mechanism right? 

So I’ll be going as a homeless person, complete with a hobo stick, cardboard sign, and 5 o’clock shadow. Any other ideas? Maybe I’ll get a tin can and donate the proceeds to the local shelter? Maybe too much. 




Edit:
Wow, came home from said job, opened up Reddit and holy poop. Thank you for your kind words and empathy, and for your comments that made me laugh on an otherwise shitty day. 


To everyone who is in a similar position to me, I hope that new doors and opportunities open up for you, and that you have friends & family to support you. After a particularly bad year, this quote from Bojack Horseman getting me through it all:


“Okay. Carolyn, you are the star of a movie. This is the part of the movie where you get your heart broken. Where the world tests you, and people treat you like shit. But it has to happen this way. Otherwise, the end of the movie, when you get everything you want, won’t feel as rewarding. There are assholes out there, but in the end, they don’t matter. Because this movie’s not about them. It’s never been about them.”
“All this time, the movie’s been about you.”

Bleep bop bloop beep bleep. Thanks again everyone for making me smile :)He's the best boss ive ever had.  My car is my job since i deliver food.   I just cut a huge check but left myself enough money i thought i would be fine.  Then my car broke down.  It was about 40 short of what the repair cost.  I  asked them if i could pay as much as i had and then pay the difference on payday next week.  I got  answered what i expected, too many people to advantage - we dont do it anymore.  I begrudgingly asked my boss for 40 dollars forward from my check so j could get back to work.  He handed me his card and said "how long have you worked for me now?" He doesn't want paid back, but i plan on paying him the same way i would have the mechanic, but now i can at least breath from the stress.  This isnt all he does.   He never leaves to go home without personally thanking everyone by name before he leaves.  Thats the kind of boss he is.

Edit - thanks for all the kind words for my boss.  I got him a card today and picked up the car with a receipt for him.  I am working with a payment plane for the next paycheck to have his generosity as a pressure valve instead of charity.  And to the people saying he is being nice to enslave workers into a bad spot,  thats awful.  He watches people go from high school, to going through college and getting their careers started.  Employees come back for emergency help on a weekend or elsewhere, not for extra cash, but because a great person is in a bind.When I was 15 years old I was able to begin attending college full time through a concurrent enrollment program for high schoolers that was offered through the local community college.

When I was 17 I had completed my Associate's degree and I graduated from my High School as Valedictorian.

Now, at 19 years and a little over a month old, I have completed my Bachelors degree (in Economics for anyone curious). I was the youngest graduate this year at my University.  


I'm giddy about being graduated and very proud of what I've accomplished. When I began taking college classes four years ago I had never dreamed that I'd be able to complete my degree this young. Thanks to a tremendous amount of support from a lot of loving people who helped me to succeed and who gave me the resources I needed to chase this opportunity I was able to, and now I get to find another adventure!My gf and I were both living off our savings while looking for a rental, which opened us up to living in areas we might not have otherwise considered. We found a massive, beautiful, recently remodeled townhouse well within our budget and half a mile from the office I had just gotten hired at. 

We had both mostly lived in middle-class suburbs before. The week we moved in, there was a murder at the gas station located at the entrance of our neighborhood. This area was always "the bad part of town" in my mind and in the minds of my peers. When people asked where we lived, we named the interstate exit and never our street. 

The first week I lived there, I was considering putting bars on the lower level windows. I nearly jumped out of my skin one night when I heard footsteps in the woods behind the house. I was almost ready to run inside to grab a knife when a fat, trash eating possum waddled by. "Phew! I thought you might be a crackhead," I'll never admit to thinking. 

After two years, I've come to realize that I don't live in a bad neighborhood. It's just a not-mostly-white and low-income neighborhood. I have neighbors of every color and we all wave at each other, talk, laugh, and get along. 

If I forget to take my trash out on trash day, my next door neighbor often does it for me. That shit never happened in the suburbs. There's a stray cat that has gained about 5 kitty pounds recently because me and both the houses next to me have been feeding the little shit. That's pretty cool and neighborly. 

Last Friday my gf and I were out back at 3am. We heard a rustling in the woods. Soon after a tall, shadowy figure of a black man appeared. No panic was felt. I have since learned that it could be a possum or it could be a homeless person. I've had many nights where a homeless person comes walking through the woods and we get to talking and hanging out. Sometimes I share my booze with them, sometimes I share some food, and on a couple occasions I give them a blanket and let them sleep on my lawn chair. So when a shadowy figure of a black man appeared at 3am, I didn't panic. Instead I called out, "hey, Too Tall? That you?!" It was him. 

So, the prejudice I have overcome isn't color based like you might have assumed. It was class based. I no longer immediately equate low income with dangerous and ignorant. 

This might be a little heavy for this sub, but I can't think of a better place to talk about this without it turning into a shit show. So, please, share your thoughts. I just renewed my lease another two years. Reddit is making my life a bit difficult...trying to choose the prediction winner but I keep getting an error message!

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pzn1th)So, I (30F, USA) had a craving for Chinese food last night. I live by myself and usually order delivery, but needed to get out of my apartment. I decided to go to a restaurant down the street from where I live. I was a bit self-conscious about eating out alone, but figured it was better than sitting at home doing nothing.

I ordered my food and the server brought it to me with chopsticks. A little embarrassed, I said, "Thank you, but could you please bring me a fork as well? I never learned how to use chopsticks."

She came back a few seconds later with a fork and another pair of chopsticks. She handed me the fork and then sat down across the table from me. She unwrapped the chopsticks and said, "It's really easy. I'll teach you."

She spent the next 2-3 minutes giving me a tutorial in chopstick usage. When she was finished, she pulled an extra pair of chopsticks from her apron, handed them to me and said, "Here, so you can practice."

It was honestly the best human contact I've had in a while and it really meant a lot to me. I just wanted to share this somewhere.

&#x200B;

Edit: I just want to say that I've been incredibly overwhelmed by the response to this post. Please know that I read every single comment and message. The kindness -- and appreciation for kindness -- that I've seen since sharing this story has meant more to me than I could ever put into words. My kid wanted to chill on his ipad, I was going for a run with the dog and asked him if he'd like to come, he was like NO WAY. I was hoping to get him away from screens for an hour and tried to be more persuasive. He proposed the we do Rock, Paper, Scissors and if he won he could chill on screens for the night but If i won he would come on the run (4 miles). I agreed. The first round was two rocks. The second (very exciting for everyone else in the family) round I won and although he was disappointed, he didn't whine, moan or try to backtrack in any way shape or form. He just put on his trainers and grumbled "let's go then'. I'm so proud of the man he is becoming, he's so much better than me in so many ways. I reinforced to him how proud I was of him for honoring his part of the bargain so gracefully. When we got back, I told the rest of the kids he had won them screens for the night and they all owed him one. He's just a great son and big bro.I tried to end my life on October 4, 2018 when I was too tired of living. College was hard, I isolated myself, and I didn’t see a point in carrying on- no need to really elaborate on that.

Anyway, after I was released from the mental hospital after being there for a week, I had a long road to walk. I had to figure out how to get back on track with school, how to explain to my friends where I was, had to figure out the response for missed interview calls. And before even being committed, I hadn’t washed my hair in a week. 

The first thing I did after finally getting my keys and car back was drive to the nearest Great Clips. I was makeupless, hair was matted and oily, and I was scared and embarrassed. I was just a walk-in, and this wonderful, older African American man greeted me, asked if I was okay after seeing my tears, and told me he’d make time. 

Immediately I felt comfortable with him because of his kindness and because he wasn’t judgmental. He slowly, carefully combed through every inch of my hair, promising he wouldn’t cut off more than the ends, even though I said it was alright if he needed to. He helped me gently lay my neck down on the edge of the sink and scrubbed through my hair with shampoo and let my hair soak up the deep conditioning treatment he massaged through my ends. He dried my hair, trimmed only the ends, and added some leave in conditioner and told me I wouldn’t have to touch it for 2-3 days.

I started crying.

He asked if it was okay to hug me, and I said yes. I am normally a very chatty person, but I’d barely spoken a word the entire time. I continued crying for a while while he hugged me. After we let go, he brought me a tissue. He gave me a moment to gather myself, I checked out, and I tipped him 100%.

I never learned his name and he never learned mine, but I think of him often. Such a small act of kindness meant the world to me. I graduate in 212 days, and as silly as it sounds, I don’t know if I would have made it without him going the extra mile for me when he could have simply done his job as normal. My success is not my own; I would never be here if it weren’t for my family, for my friends, and for the kind souls that I encountered just for a moment.

Thank you so much, Great Clips gentleman. I hope you are doing so well.

Edit 1: Wow, everyone! I am so overwhelmed by the positive response I've received. Thank you all so much for going out of your way to give the kind comments, awards, DMs, and upvotes. I have been trying to respond to everyone, and I promise I'm going through my messages as quickly as I am able. I have read every single one, and I am so touched. And thank you to everyone who has asked, I am so much better now. It is all thanks to my family and friends and sweet strangers. 

Edit 2: I called the Great Clips this morning and gave my description this morning. Unfortunately, the lady said there are no men on the team and have not been for over a year now. Thanks to the suggestion of u/Ctrl_Shift_ZZ, I was able to ask if they had a record of my old hair appointments. I had to use my old phone number for lookup, but the last recorded appointment they have of mine was in 2016. I was still in high school at that time. The lady on the phone said if the appointment was not showing up, he must not work there anymore. 

I asked if there was anyone that worked at that location since 2018, and she said no. She said after Covid, their employee turnover was very high and they have an almost-completely-new staff. I think she could tell I was pressed to find him, so she told me she would ask around for me.  She asked for my number and said that she would call back in a few days if she finds something. She was so kind; I hope she does find some lead and call back. I really am trying!They appeared to be celebrating after the kid’s soccer game and the dad was yelling at his son, “WHO’S NUMBER 26!?” and the little boy was yelling “I AM!!” and then the dad switched it up and said, “BUT WHO’S NUMBER 1 IN DADDY’s HEART?!” and the little boy got even more excited and yelled “I AM!!!”

It’s nice to see dads being affectionate with their kids (especially sons). It’s not too common in my experience.I just wanted to tell someone. 

I have things I'm supposed to be doing right now. Cleaning, projects, or working out. I have so many things I should be doing, and if I'm not doing them I should be using this time to sleep.

That being said, right now my 10-year-old cat is sprawled across my lap, her chin on my leg. My 15-year-old cat, living with a tumour in her throat but somehow still thriving, is laying to my right and snoring like crazy. The TV is off. The room is silent. All I hear is her snoring. All I feel is the faint twitches and sleepy purrs of the love on my lap. I'm reading a book I've read thirty times but I keep putting it down to appreciate this moment in time. 

I know it's not much, but it's real and it's beautiful. I just wanted to tell someone. My life really sucks right now but there is peace here. I want to hang on to this forever. I know it's fleeting and before I know it they'll both be gone but for right now, right here, I am so happy. I want to hang on to this forever. 

I hope you all are having good nights, too.So I recently went on a long trip to Europe and just came back home a few days ago. The other day I was in a large gas station convenience store and it just hit me. The employees making my sandwich were overweight, the cashier was overweight, and many other customers were also very overweight. As I am writing this right now in a cafe, I am observing the same as well. While I was in Europe I barely saw people like this and if I did they were tourists. Now that I am back home it’s like I cannot unsee it. 

I don’t mean to judge anyone, obviously many people have medical related issues, I think it’s just interesting to see the major difference in eating habits and lifestyles between Europe and the U.S. Is it the quality of food? General lifestyle differences? Anyone else notice the same?So several time ago I found a spider (which was actually a daddy long legs) hanging under the handrail in my room. I usually hate spiders, but instead of giving in to my hatred or saving him, I thought it would be pretty cool to have a SpiderBro hangin around in my apartment. Thus, I decided to keep him and name him Tom.

This is where the drama started. He was shy at first, and his webskills were "not the best" (which is a blatant euphemism). Also, I don't think he was the smartest of his kind, since he was hangin in a place that probably wouldn't catch a lot. As I already connected with him on a super deep level and wanted to show him how much I care, I threw some moths (which I hate passionately) into his lousy excuse of a web. After some time, he turned to my gifts, and I was content that I could contribute to his happiness with my love.

The next morning I found the moths on the floor. Confused and ignoring the obvious red flag, I threw them into his web again. In addition to that and some point later, I killed a wasp without squishing it too much, and it took me several attempts to make it stick in those few threads he could manage to tangle up. As I said, his webskills sucked. Again he turned to it at some point and I found joy seeing how he sucked the life out of that dude.

However, the next morning, the wasp was lying on the floor. This is where I should have drawn the line. The second red flag. Instead, I took some attempts to give it back, which was not easy, since Tom is a complete imbecile. I tended to my business as usual afterwards and carefully touched the wasp from time to time to let him know that he can eat again.

The next morning he was gone. Just gone. Nothing. Not even weaving me goodbye. I was pretty sad but thought he probably needed something else in his life. So I moved on, as hard as it was.

Today I chilled on my balcony, reminiscing about my life choices. And guess who I found, just on the other side of the window. Yes. A daddy long legs, hangin around innocently in the corner of the other side of the handrail. Just outside.

I feel betrayed. Heartbroken. There he was. I knew it could only be him, since his web has caught less than the amount of fucks everybody gave about him before I took him in. I guess he needed to move on.

Fuck you Tom. I hope all you catch is low protein.

PS: I rested my head next to him while sitting outside to show him I still exist in the whole magnificence of my passive aggression, but he just ignored me. Fuck you, Tom.

&nbsp;

Edit: Silver? I will vigorously flaunt these newfound riches to let Tom know that he could have been part of great wealth! Thank you kind stranger!

&nbsp;

Edit 2: That's my first gold, good gracious, thank you! I think Tom starts to realize what he's missing out on, cause I just checked on him and he was all upside-down.

&nbsp;

Update: After waking up today, I felt strangely free. Your support really helped me in these dark times, and I think I've reached the point where I can say: I'm over you, Tom. When I checked on him this morning, I felt like a survivor. 
Also, yesterday I saw a silverfish. He was even more shy than Tom and almost instantly tried to hide, which was kind of cute. Who knows what happens. Keeping it casual this time.So ive been going to Dunkin Donuts almost every day now because of this new drink they have thay ive been in love with. So I went through like i normally did today and the girl who took my card is someone I see pretty much every time I go

Well when i got my drink and i was about ready to go but she stopped me and said "Hey i just wanted to let you know that everytime when you come through you make all of us smile." It caught me so off guard i said thank you and drove off because i started crying! Its been such a rough time recently with everything going on right now i just felt so happy that someone would say something like that. 

Didnt wanna brag i just felt like sharing a moment that made me feel good :)First time poster so unsure if this even fits on this sub. On mobile so formatting/spelling is likely shit.

So this is random but it recently occurred again, I googled it and recieved the sweet sweet vindication of being right all along. 

When I was a kid (maybe 7 or 8?) I would be laying in bed at night and suddenly it would feel like the room was massive and I was very very tiny. It's so hard to explain the sensation, but almost as though the room is expanding at an alarming rate and I'm lost in the cavernous space. Sometimes it was my bed that felt enormous as well/instead and closing my eyes would make it much worse. It legit kept me up at night and I would cry for my mom completely terrified. My poor mother had no idea how to help me and just chalked it up to an overactive imagination. 

Well it turns out it's called Alice in Wonderland Syndrome and my version is just one form of it, you can see other crazy shit if you have an episode too. I don't blame my parents because I sounded like a little kid having nightmares and I was having such a hard time explaining it. Your kid just says the room feels too big and you're gonna be like oooooooook...? 

Anyway I would love to hear if anyone has a similar experience with AIWS or even just stories of your parents not believing you where you were proven right in the end.

Edit/Update: I just want to say how blown away I am by all of the responses! I was expecting like 7 people to say "hey me too!". I tried to keep up with the comments at first but was quickly overwhelmed. I'm trying to at least read them all and I want to say thank you all for this amazing reaction 💖I mean if Ellen can get it (nothing against Ellen), shouldn't he? Imagine how many lives he's affected through his free education platform. Not only was he one of the first to make free educational videos, but he's consistently the best at it. He has a true skill for boiling down concepts into an understandable form. 


I think it would be a real shame if he doesn't receive this award - it's the highest honor a civilian can receive and he's truly deserving of it.


Edit: No, not the actor

Edit: No, not before 2021I’m a divorced, single parent. I’m laid off from my job as of 2 weeks ago and I decided this is the perfect time to go back to school. I applied about 10 minutes ago. I’m nervous about how I will afford it, how I will take care of my kids while taking classes, but I know it will add security to our lives that my current job isn’t providing (I’m a janitor). 

I just wanted to share with someone.

Edit: I wanted to tell everyone I’m trying to respond to all your encouraging messages, but I’m a bit overwhelmed. So thank you so much for all the support and advice!

I did want to edit again to address what I’ve been messaged about quite a bit: I do not plan to take on any loans. I’ve applied for financial aid, the Pell Grant, and a dozen scholarships. Even if it takes me 5 years to get an associates, I’m hoping to do it without incurring debt. If anyone knows of other grants or aid, I’d appreciate a heads up. (I’m not sure when I’ll be able to speak with a financial advisor with the whole Covid-19 situation right now)

I’m sorry for another edit, but I’m getting messaged with the same questions and wanted to address it here.  I’ve enrolled at community college to start. I haven’t decided exactly what degree, but I’m leaning toward business/IT. The school I’ve applied to has certification for both of those that I can get in 2 semesters and then get a better job while I’m working toward a degree. 

Thank you again, so much, for the encouragement and advice. I definitely need it, and I’m reading every message and responding to as many as I can.I might need to re-evaluate my friendships...

They said such wholesome and kind things in my absence. I haven’t been very pleasant to be around lately due to stress and I was honestly convinced they were annoyed by my crap. But no, even when I am not around, they appreciate me and I’ve totally taken that for granted. 

I think it’s also a friendly reminder that the insecurities and anxieties in your head are sometimes so wildly far from the truth. 

Anyway, they didn’t know the reason behind it but I treated them to a home cooked meal last night as a secret thank you :)

EDIT: Oh jeez didn't expect this to blow up, I'll try to answer and read everything!**Update**: [I left a card this morning](https://imgur.com/a/u4NdZjc), I did my best to sterilize it by wiping it with bleach clothes but uh, yeah, it's paper lol.  The apartment is mostly as I remember, though I was harsh with my wording.  The stairs are designed in the same way a film-set features stairs, kinda romantic from my vantage point.  The car was already gone and it was the only spot empty, and being just 5-10mins earlier than yesterday, I'll assume it is theirs.  I hope they aren't offended by the way I described anything or for disturbing the peace.  Gotta admit, I was nervous writing the card!  I did leave instructions to the subreddit and the title of the post in case they wanted to say hi or read the story, so I guess now we wait... 

*Original Post:*

I can’t believe I’m typing this, I’m a muscular dude in my late 20s, gruffy beard, etc - not the emotional type!

I just saw a man, standing in the doorway with an untied tie around his neck and briefcase in hand, kissing his wife and baby goodbye as he went to work.  They live in one of those ~~shanty~~ (just not the right word) drive-up apartments you see in LA, an old single unit on top of the building garage.  The front door is at the top of steps which are completely exposed to the outside (LA, ha).   

Anyway, after he closed the door and went down a step or two, the wife and baby pop out from behind blinds in an adjacent window.  They all laugh, smile.  He kisses the baby through the glass, mom waves the baby’s hand, and he glides down a few more steps.  Mom and baby smile one last time before fading behind the curtains again.  Dad goes another step before looking back, pausing, but nothing.  He waits.  Still nothing, so he goes on.  Before I knew it, he jumped into a jalopy of a Toyota and took off.  

Honestly guys, I’m in awe, it was beautiful.

I’m pulled over to the side of the the road right now, safely, as I’m on my morning bike ride.

Edit:  I'm getting some nasty (and nice!) comments/PMs about *my* perception of my appearance.  No I'm not the emotional type, but of course I have emotions; a lot of them!  I just don't typically cry in public, and I'm sure it'd be odd to come upon a guy with tears rolling into his beard!  That's all.Yes, her rendition of the National Anthem was... not great. But I feel like the people of the internet forget celebrities are people, too, and they're being really harsh.


There was a Reddit confession from am anonymous A-lister a few months ago where the gal talked about reading through the malicious comments about her on social media and getting more and more depressed. The post was eventually locked because people kept trying to guess who she was. (Many people seem to think it was Kim Kardashian.)


That post really hit me, because she was venting that she was so depressed because of this internet bullying that the only reason she hadn't committed suicide was because of her family and kids.


So, not knowing where else to post this, I just wanted to say that while Fergie may not have done a great job singing the anthem, she's still a human being with real emotions. People need to take a chillaxative and quit being so harsh over something so relatively inconsequential.

Just because someone is famous, or just because you've never met them, doesn't make it any less serious or hateful to bash on them. It's still bullying.

I guess I'm just venting because people *reeaally* like to jump on the bashing bandwagon and I'm sick of it. That is all.


 **Edit:** Hello, all. This definitely got more of a response than I was expecting, and while I'd love to respond to everyone, I have some things to do, so in a mass response to everyone:

- Thank you to all the lovely people who took part in this post, whether for or against this opinion. I'm happy this started a good discussion.

- I understand that it's Fergie's job to sing and whatnot, but someone doing a bad job at something almost never justifies treating them like garbage. (Unless someone started a nuclear war or killed an entire family or something; by all means, rip away at 'em.) As with everything in life, there is definitely a gray area, and you are more than welcome to have a differing opinion - I just don't want to be a person that adds any more heartache to the world than necessary. There is already enough of that.

- Obligatory "Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!"

Okay, that's all I've got for now. Have a nice day, everybody.


**Edit 2:** Okay, I know I have stuff to do, but lots of people are commenting stuff along the lines of, "Well, she gets paid a lot of money, so it doesn't really matter."

Well, here's my reply I made to one of those commenters:

>Well, I can agree that her life is definitely financially easier than the majority of our lives. 

>However, there's a reason the phrase "money can't buy happiness" exists.

>Money solves the physical problems - better healthcare, better food, better clothes, better cars, and so on.

>Still, while the "landscape" is different, the base problems are still the same - fear of death, humiliation, depression, jealousy, frustration, et cetera.

>That's what makes us human - those feelings, those fears, those desires.

>All I'm saying is, let's not forget that people like her are people, too. The entertainment industry, while financially lucrative, is extremely emotionally taxing.

So I’m 32 and never have really understood what younger folks call “vibing”. But I think I finally get it. Tonight my wife and I had a good home cooked dinner and a few glasses of wine each. Now after I’ve done the dishes I’m sitting out on my porch, listening to the Cardinals baseball game on the radio, sipping coffee, and watching bats swoop and play in the sunset sky. All the while I hear wild turkeys off in the distance. I feel perfectly at peace and feel like this must be what everyone keeps talking about haha. 

So good on you guys and gals who get to feel like this so often!I've basically become a shut-in thanks to a certain virus. Haven't been out of the house in months other than for buying essentials. Haven't seen any of my friends and I don't talk to people much in chats (I just don't like chatting very much). 

So today I got a call from my landlord saying he wanted to show the house to some potential tenants (I'm planning on moving soon), I was hesitant at first but I ultimately agreed. I was kind of bummed about it though. 

A few hours later he comes in with his daughter, who says she wanted to meet me. Turns out she is really into music, and she heard I play some instruments from her father. She asks me to play something so ~~naturally I started playing Wonderwall~~ I played the solo I was practicing and she really liked it. Then she asked me to sing a song, so I sang her a song called "Sham" which she loved! and just said "You sing really well!"

And I don't know why, something as simple as that almost made me cry (I didn't actually cry in front of her though) Maybe it was the way she said it, maybe it was because I was feeling really lonely today. But it honestly made my day.

Just wanted to share my happiness today. Sorry if this is a weird post.I love my cat to bits, and he loves me too. He's wary of strangers, and has never strayed far. We've had him since he was a kitten, and his name is Midnight. He's a completely black cat, with one hell of a personality.

He went missing 5 days ago, after we started dog-sitting a family friend's dog. We used to foster dogs and we also own our own dog, so he's used to having dogs around. He's an outdoor cat, so when he didn't come back the first day or even the second day, no one was \*too\* worried, but once it got to the third day I was screaming internally.

He came back today- we saw him on the security camera, right outside our front door. I ran to the door and started calling for him and, for the first time in 5 days, he meowed back! I threw open the door, scooped him up and he has had his every wish tended to since then. Fancy cat food, treats, and the best scratches behind his ears and under his chin.

I've never been this happy in my life. He's my best friend and he completely understands me.

I've never been so happy to have all my things covered in cat hair.

[Here's some pictures of my cat, Midnight.](https://imgur.com/gallery/QYqGedz)

&#x200B;

EDIT: wow, this completely blew up overnight! Thanks everyone for the kind words and good wishes (and awards), an update on Midnight, he has been spending every second with me since his return, and is more affectionate than ever!I haven't been able to work in the last 2 weeks because I was waiting for my covid results, and because I've been at the house, I've noticed a pattern.

I live in a house with 3 of my siblings, my mom, and my stepdad. We're all independent of each other because we all have different schedules and needs, so we don't eat together. I've come to realize that my youngest sister has greatly taken advantage of that. She wakes up before the rest of us and lays in bed until the next person gets up, which is me. She asks me everyday to make her an egg while I make my breakfast. I make her an egg and toast I make myself some eggs and we eat together pretty much every morning. Then my stepdad wakes up and usually by then I'm already at work, but because I haven't been working I was in my room. I heard her ask him to make her oatmeal. He makes her oatmeal and makes his oatmeal then they eat together every single day roughly an hour after I make her breakfast. Then my stepdad goes to work and my other sister wakes up. The little one asks her for frozen waffles and they eat waffles together every day after she eats her oatmeal. Then my brother gets up at around noon and makes pizza bites or a hot pocket or something like that and she asks him to make some extra for her. He does and they eat their junkie lunch together everyday.

Basically, my youngest sister gets up to 4 breakfasts a day because we don't communicate about who is feeding her, so everyone just does it. She knows our schedules and plans her feeding times around them.

Edit: To everyone thinkng that she's being neglected, abused, not properly cared for, going to get obese, or anything else negative like that- go away don't bother commenting. I've gotten plenty of those already and I'm sick of defending myself to a bunch of strangers. I know what's going on in my house and family better than any random on reddit who has never met any of us and clearly knows nothing about children. Thanks:)I like the softer fabrics on my lips, I like that my autistic natural "resting bitch face" is covered so people don't assume that I'm mad. Also, some public places and some people in them smell way less upsetting now.

Just me? Do you wanna go back, or keep it?A couple weeks ago, I had to send a super long email to our president explaining a situation that happened at work. It was super thorough and had lots of attachments and numbers and other boring stuff. He's a super busy dude and assuming he wanted to know what happened and involve who he need to who would review the finer points, so I added a "TL;DR" and put the quick, two-sentence synopsis at the end.

A couple hours go by and he calls me and ask what the heck "tillder" means. I explained that because the email was so long, I added the short "too long; didn't read" for him so he'd get the picture without having to read the entire narrative. He thought it was awesome and ended up forwarding the email to the entire company explaining "tillder" and now everyone is using it.

TL;DR: I sent the company president an email with "TL;DR" in it and he thought it was cool and now everyone else uses it.Lots of other people passed me as I cried whilst stress smoking a cigarette. Most went silent as they passed me. But a homeless man and his adorable dog came over to me to check I was okay, and I got to pet his dog. He showed me kindness today, and although he could do nothing to alliviate my terrible day, he delivered more compassion than anyone else who saw mr. He's lifted my day simply by being kind and can't even thank him properly. So I'm telling reddit, maybe we can all pay that kindness forward and help someone like me that you happen upon.

Edit: thanks for reading this everyone, I'm sorry I can't keep up with all the comments. But it brightened my day to read all the stories. For those of you that have also broken down in the street, remember that struggling alone is no way to live. Reach out for help, and be kind to yourself. We can't fix people we see on distress but we can show compassion. Sometimes that's all that's needed.The Indian festival, which is known as Diwali is celebrated all over India and everyone celebrating it wishes and prays for happiness, prosperity and enlightenment!I don’t really make a big deal about Mother’s Day. It’s just a meh holiday for me that I usually use as an excuse to eat fun food. But I honestly and truly expect nothing. 

I came downstairs, made some breakfast and coffee and played on my phone until my 16 year old woke up. She strolled down around 10, grabbed a cup of coffee and sat with me on the couch. We started chatting about her dance show recently, and about all of the dances her and her friends had created. Suddenly the conversation shifted and we were chatting about her friends within her dance group, and she opened up completely about some things that were going on with her and her friends. Things I think she had been wanting to chat about but didn’t know how. One of her close friends has been struggling with an eating disorder (her mother is apparently aware and they are working on it) and she has been concerned for her, another has bad panic attacks in class. One friend realized she was bisexual and has a crush on another friend in the group, however she recognized that it hasn’t made anything weird between the two and everyone has been really accepting. 

She just chatted away about the things that are prominent in their lives right now as teenagers, things they are struggling with. Things that worried her. Things they are learning about life. And I couldn’t have loved and appreciated it more. I would have NEVER talked to my mom about these things. She wasn’t approachable, she overreacted about everything. I hid it all and I got into a lot of trouble. I am so thankful that my daughter felt like she could come to me and speak openly about her life, and trusted me enough to tell me these tough things. She had no idea she just completely made my day.I’m a 19 year old guy and other than my family I have never gotten a genuin complement from someone. Today after work I my family ordered Chinese food and I went to go pick it up. I got there a little early so I had to sit and wait about 15 minutes for it to be ready. About 5 minutes after I got there 2 girls, probably my age, walked in and it looked like they were waiting too. I saw one of them wearing a Fear of the Dark Iron Maiden shirt and I was pretty surprised because they didn’t look like the type of people who would like that stuff. Most people who do are much older than me. Naturally I said I like your shirt because cmon, who doesn’t like Iron Maiden. She said thank you and said she’s had plenty more. I asked her if she knew about the new album that could be coming in 2020 and she knew all about it. Our food came at about the same time and we were leaving so I held the door open for them like a gentleman and she said thank you and said “now that I’m closer i can see you have pretty eyes”. I was pretty dumbstruck because no one has really ever said anything like that to me out of nowhere. I kind of just smiled and chuckled a little bit. I said “it was good talking to you” and I was off. It made my whole day.Edit: My friends, I gotta go to sleep. I promise I'll get back to all pending comments as soon as possible. Keep posting if you need to. I will get back to all eventually.and instead said, "Can I please have the strippin' chicks?"

I looked at my shoes and held my breath. After a few beats his mom burst out laughing, and then I did too!

It's been like a dozen years since this happened and I still smile when I happen to remember it.

I hope somewhere out there there's a teen that doesn't mind getting ribbed by his family about this story. It's too good not to treasure.In an age where we're expected to be working at all times and constantly available during off hours, here's a reminder to use this time to chill out and take care of you, as much as possible. You're allowed to do nothing without feeling guilty about it (working from home excluded).I’ve done this before, it fucking sucks, but I want to stick with it. I had quit before, then I went to Cancun and thought wtf - that was a dumb idea.

If you don’t already smoke or use nicotine products, DON’T! It’s wonderful at first but then the great buzz subsides and then it’s something you need just to be normal. It’s pointless and expensive, don’t do it.

Don’t really have anyone to share this with so I’m posting here. I see a lot of posts about various substances and “quitting” and I always wonder how long that will last. For me, for now, I’ve done it before and I believe I can do it again. Thanks for reading, wish me luck.

Edit: WOW, this blew up! Thanks so much for the support everyone, as of this update it is now 36 hours on the dot! 

Update: Officially 48 hrs, 2 Days now. I appreciate everyone and their comments! I will push on to tomorrow, 48hrs free is too many to give up now! Thanks all of you - and keep fighting, everyone!I had a wonderful experience today. An Uber driver picked me up and took me from my hotel down to a store where I wanted to pick up a few beers and something to eat in my hotel that doesn't come from room service or the bar. It was just before 6 am (I'm a regular visitor to the country from a timezone where 6 am here is 3 pm for me at home). In casual conversation I asked him if he had just started work for today. He replied that he'd been up all night and had to work until he'd made another $75. His rent is due today.

Anyway, he waited whilst I bought my beer and food. I paid the cashier and on the way out noticed a cash machine at the door. One of those that you have to draw cash in $20 bills. I don't know what I was thinking but $75 isn't that much money that you can't help a fellow human being out. I drew $80.

When he dropped me off I asked him if I could tip him in cash rather than on the Uber app and of course he was okay with that. When he saw the money he started crying. It was a $10 ride. He got out of the car with me and gave me a hug. He wouldn't let me go for the longest and most beautiful hug I've had in years.

I said, "Go get some sleep bro." 

Sleep tight Alvin.I'm a 42 year old man and by the last episode I was bawling.  The last episode just had me thinking about wife and I and I couldn't keep it together.  I have never reacted this way to any movie or tv show.  It left my wife pretty perplexed.  

She didn't watch the show with me and had no idea the message that was conveyed etc.  By the time I finished the last episode she basically had to put me to bed like an over emotional toddler.

Now I'm sitting here trying to organize my thoughts about the whole experience and I actually feel pretty good, better than I've felt in a long time.

I just wanted to share, thanks for listening.I’m lying in bed with my 5 month old [Schnauzer](https://imgur.com/gallery/PPt8dbb) and my wife who is also 32 weeks pregnant with our first child (boy). My puppy is licking my hand whenever I go to pet him and my wife is giving appreciative sounds when I reach over to rub her head or her back. 

I know the world is basically on fire at the moment, but it’s really the little things like this that make it all worth living. I will gladly sacrifice everything if it means these three live a better/happier life.This had just happened to me a hour ago.

I had just gotten off work at 3 from my job at a convenient store. It is located right next to a red light and as I walked to my car someone got t boned and a lady got thrown from her car.

I froze for a second and just stared at her and then ran over to her. She wasn’t breathing and she had no pulse. Her face was bloody and messed up. Someone then ran over to me and asked if I knew CPR and I couldn’t speak I just nodded and started giving this woman CPR

Someone had called 911 but I was giving her CPR for what felt forever. But she had them opened her eyes and gasped. She looked at me with this stare of fear then closed her eyes again and told her to keep her eyes open but she kept them closed. She was breathing so I knew she was ok but I was scared for her. It wasn’t until now that I realized there was people standing around me all looking at me. It didn’t feel real .

It wasn’t until a few minutes later the ambulance got there. Before they took off someone asked me for my number. I think it was there husband. The police also took my phone number had asked me what happened and I told them.

I don’t know what will happen next am just hoping she will be ok.

UPDATE: I got a call around 9 today informing me that the lady had passed away shortly after getting to the hospital. It’s sad but I was told she had internal bleeding.

It’s made me wonder. Some of you have mentioned that it doesn’t make sense that she revived, it makes me wonder if she even did. Maybe it was just twitching that I thought was a gasp I really don’t know but would be interested in hearing from any doctors about that possibility. Something I do know is her eyes opened and I swear to you she looked at me before they closed again. Someone had told me I don’t know if it’s mentioned in the comments but in a traumatic situation the brain can tell you something happened that didn’t, I really don’t know to be honest with you.

On a less sad note I would please like to encourage everyone to learn CPR you don’t need to be certified just know what your doing. Getting certified could help a lot however even if you just get Level A. 

Some people had asked me about my training so I thought I would mention it here even though I mentioned it in comments.

I am Level C certified from the Canadian Red Cross. I was taught in Grade 9 gym and Grade 11 Outdoor ED where it was mandatory to learn.

I would also like to mention I am still working on getting tested. The line is ridiculous long so I have to wait awhile.

Just adding in here since someone said about it. It was not the hospital that called me it was the husband 

Also thank you everyone for all the up votes and rewards I am truly thankful for it all.Last night I had a dream where I was with the perfect woman for me. We were happy together and the dream ended when I fell asleep next to her. I woke up realizing it wasn't real at all and I'll have been feeling really depressed sinceFor context, I'm 20 and he just turned 13. We know eachother through our parents. We usually play minecraft or other games when he's over. He's hyperactive and goes to a special school.
At first, I didn't want to stay long, mostly because I thought there would be friends his age. I was shocked when he told me that all his friends cancelled at the last moment, so I decided to stay and play games with him till late night. I could tell that he was quite happy that I came.

I don't regret going now. I can't imagine him having to blow the birthday candles alone.

EDIT: Thank you all for your wonderfull comments.I stopped in at the liquor store where my son works today to pick up some beer for a little party we were having.  My son was in the cooler working and he said "Hey dad..." when I got there and I acknowledged him and he got back to work.  My son has Asperger's Syndrome.  He's quirky and quiet.  But, if you have a kid on the autism spectrum, you just really never know what they will accomplish or be able to do.

Anyway, I get my stuff and I am checking out and the owner says to me "Is <kid's name> your son?"  I said "Yes."  Owner says "I love that kid.  He works hard.  The customers like him, too."  It was unsolicited and out of earshot of my son.  It was nice to hear.I (21F) finally fucking stood up for myself. 21 long years and I feel like I’ve broken a barrier.

Ever since I was young, I have been abused by men. Growing up into my teenage years I was cheated on, lied, used, in every possible way. 

Today my ex- who I have not seen in 10 months came back to town and showed true indication that he had changed and became a better man and thus I agreed to meet with him.

2 minutes into sitting down at a bar he upped and left with a friend of his and left me there for 15 minutes alone: the old me and that relationship would have sat there and waited until he came back but I realised in that very moment 3 things-

I do not deserve to be someone’s door mat

I do not deserve to be an afterthought

I love myself and I respect myself more than this to put myself through this again.

As I got in the Uber to go home I hear a whistle behind me, and .. I didn’t look back. I didn’t stop, I just got into the Uber and said “please, drive as fast as you can out of here”.

I am proud of me. And if nobody else is- fuck it at least I am. My tattooed manifesto finally became manifested-

Beg for nothing, bow to none.
[for those who wanted to see the tattoo](https://imgur.com/gallery/0qokkYd)Right now I’m just a lunch lady at a middle school. I was taking some food to a class and one of the students I talk to saw me and yelled, “Hey! That’s my favorite lunch lady!” Then she hugged me and I was like woah. I never thought the students or anyone else ever really noticed me.

It made me happy to know that I’m a kids favorite lunch lady. 

Life is good.

Edit: I went to bed when this had like 10 upvotes, but I want to thank you guys for being so nice! Today is a good day already!I’m not talking about bodybuilder muscles or men’s fashion and all that, but I just mean naturally and generally speaking, their body features are so satisfying to the eye. I love that. I love a sharp, big nose on men, I love square jaws, thick natural eyebrows, broad shoulders... I also love how deep their voices are and how nice and big their hands are. Men are just gorgeous.
I actually once had to look up why women’s bodies were so often represented in art because it blows my mind that men aren’t considered the ultimate standard for beauty. I just think men are really beautiful and I wanted to share my morning thoughts on them. Have a nice day men of reddit!I've been living by myself for over 4 years now, and my life kind of fell apart without me noticing. Every once in a while I start cleaning up some of the clutter thinking "today is the day I'm going to start fixing myself", but theres just so much to do that I give up, and it doesnt take long before any improvement I made gets replaced with even more trash than before.

So after several years of that, my house had fallen into what might be described as a pathetic state. But last week I finished up a project at work and for the first time in a long while I didnt have anything in the near future to stress over. So I took Friday and Saturday to gather up everything for once and throw it all out. As it turned out, there was a lot of it. I threw out more stuff from my house by volume than I kept in.

The place is still an embarrassment, because underneath all the garbage was a layer of dust and dirt and stains I still have to deal with. But it's probably the first time since I moved in that I dont need to tiptoe around to avoid stepping on trash.

Anyway, I just thought it was a pretty remarkable amount of bags.As the title says ggma LOOOOVES the Office. She lives in an old folks home and I usually visit her a couple times a week, I spend an hour or 2 with her. I’m one of the the few grandkids she really remembers so she loves it when I drop by. Within the past I’d say couple years or so she’s been getting into reality shows. I guess the nurses put them on in their “recreation” area. She calls it the “shit and bitch room” because people crap their pants and complain there. But she first took a liking to KUWTK and some how found her way to other reality type shows and loves them.  One of the nurses that I’ve gotten to know said he put The Office on for her one day and she got hooked so he started her from the beginning. He told me she asked if it was “one of those shows where they film people that aren’t actors” and he didn’t have the heart to tell her no so she thinks it’s a reality show.  It’s been probably around a couple month s now she she has her favorite people on there. She LOVES Michael Scott but feels bad for him because he’s such an idiot but means well. She’s all “I have no idea how that man got a job in management. He’s so stupid!” But she says he’s so funny.  She really loves to see Jim and Pam falling for each other.  We recently finished up the episodes where Jim and Pam get married and she cried tears of joy, she was so happy. Then she says “this is what I like to see! Not the whores all trying to get in bed with the same man. They have no self respect!” (the bachelor).  Haha she thinks Dwight is an idiot who thinks he knows it all and is such a kiss ass. She always says to me “I hope you’re not a kiss ass at your job! Pitiful!”  And “who in the hell lives On a farm that just grows beets?! When I was a girl we grew a lot of things in the farm, very few beets.” She HATES Angela with a passion. She always goes on about some woman named Maria that she knew that was just like her...She’s 98, turns 99 in December and is still pretty sharp. She’s forgotten a lot of her family but she knows the office really well and best of all (for me anyway) she likes the MCU movies. Lol we’ve even had conversations about Thanos where she compared him to Hitler. Big fan of Captain Rodgers as she likes to call him. We argue about who’s better between him and Tony Stark. It’s funny.  She did cry when he died in Endgame though.  “He didn’t deserve to die. Why didn’t he create a robot to use the stones?”  

Well, I could go on but if you read this much, thank you.  She’s lived a long happy life and still says she’s going to outlive us all. She just gets sad that she outlived half of her 6 kids. One of them being my grandma. The doctor says for her age she’s in great health and has quite a few years left in her. Haha I remember when I was a kid she was quiet, never cursed, went to church a few times a week. Now she doesn’t give a fuck. She curses more than me, hits on the male nurses and has no problem telling people in the home to kiss her ass. It’s hilarious.  

Wherever you’re reading this from, Have a good day or night!How are you doing? I hope you're okay. You rob us the chance to get to know you better so I made a post where I could talk to you.

Life gets hard. Sometimes we all scroll through dozens and dozens of posts hoping one of them is fit for us, this is for you. Let's talk,lets open our hearts out and talk about what causes us pain and joy.

What music are you listening to currently?
What's your favourite band?
What's your favourite book,or maybe movie?

See ya and have a great day :)

Edit: It's been a real pleasure talking with you sweet folks for 3 hours, unfortunately it's night time and my eyelids are giving up. I only made this edit so that if anyone is feeling lonely, or needs a chat they are absolutely free to comment or even DM me. In these trying times, I'm trying to extend a hand of love and positivity. Stay safe folks. I will try and reply to everyone when I wake up

Edit 2: hey y'all, I appreciate the sentiment but please don't spend your hard earned money on buying reddit awards. Buy a lot of ice creams for yourself instead

Here's a small obscure friendly sub to check out where you can talk about whatever you feel r/WholesomePals without the pressure of feeling judged.but aren't you always in a great mood? :) 

And I said "well, maybe, I didn't really think about it" and she just commented how I am most of the time happy and laughing and this made me reflect for a bit and realize that indeed, I am a very happy person :D Felt grateful for all I have and made my mood EVEN BETTER! 

Wishing you all a very nice day today!

Edit: thanks for all the love guys! For the ones struggling, hope you can find your way to feel better - every and each one of us deserve to be happy!  Nobody is happy all the time, but the important thing is to be happy MOST of the time! Feel free to send me a message if you would like to talk! 
Won't be able to reply all your comments since I need to study and do stuff, but wish you a nice (and happy) week :) xI’ve seen an increasing number of posts that start with a disclaimer that English isn’t OP’s first language, usually with an advance apology for mistakes. It’s always impressive when people can speak more than one language (hell, it’s hard enough to really master one) and I just wish people felt welcome to write whatever they wanted without being made to feel anxious about being called out for spelling/grammar mistakes etcThis happened literally 10 minutes ago. I was just heading home, the subway is pretty packed (cos I live in Shanghai and there’s not a quarantine anymore). And suddenly the subway stopped moving.

The driver announced that there will be a moment of silence for everyone who lost their lives because of COVID 19 in a few minutes.

I wasn’t sure if everyone is going to do it, because nobody seems to react to that piece of news, they’re all looking at their phones and stuff.

And when the time came, EVERYONE stopped what they’re doing and stood up. I mean EVERYONE. The guy sitting across me took off his headphones, an old dude took off his hat.

All the subway trains honked at the same time. The girl next to me started sobbing.

I still can’t believe every single one of these ppl actually all stopped what they’re doing in honour of victims around the world. We are all in this together, and we can do it.She reads the question out to me and asks “without your phone right?!”   English isn’t her first language and that’s why she isn’t familiar with the phrase. But it made me laugh out loud!Honestly just gave us a really nice smile and put us into a great mood :)

I’ve been patiently waiting for her to wake up after 3 days on the run at work and it’s difficult lol. We’ve got a nice day of shopping ahead of us & I’m looking forward to spending some quality time with her today!

What are your guys plans for the day?!

EDIT:

Thank you so much everyone for the awards and the kind words, I low-key love you all and am forever grateful for your nice words💕I've known this girl for a couple years now and we've always been really close. We met in residence in our first year of university and now in our third I live right across the street from her, so we see each other everyday. I've never been closer/more open with anyone else, but I never imagined her in a romantic context (even though everyone who knows us has told me we should date). Well, I did, but wouldn't admit it to myself.

Anyway, she recently broke up with her long-term boyfriend and since then we've been spending even more time together. I sorta took notice but didn't do or say anything different because I didn't imagine she thought of me that way and also she just got out of a break-up, so obviously she just wants company. 

But last night coming home from bar trivia she comes over as she normally does to have another drink and listen to music. We're both half-falling asleep and half-cuddling when she puts on this song that I absolutely love. Something just clicked in my head then and I lean in to kiss her.

Turns out we've both been crushing on each other for years. We stayed up all night laughing at ourselves in between kisses. It's fantastic feeling, being with a girl you already know you love. I've been smiling all day and I just had to tell someone. 

Thanks for hearing me out, reddit. Sending good vibes your way. 


**Edit** Thank you all for the well wishes and support. I'm glad that you can enjoy this as much as I am (well, probably not as much as me, but in the neighborhood). You guys are the best. 

**Edit 2** Gold! Thank you very much, stranger. Super happy that this story brightened people's days and got them to reminisce. It makes a great feeling even better. My adult rescue was found emaciated and full of quills in the wild, but she knew all of her basic commands already so no doubt she had a home prior. She showed signs of having been abused: extremely submissive around us, would flinch if we raised a hand above our head. She quickly realized we were going to love her and treat her with kindness and is slowly learning how to play and coming out of her shell. The one thing she still struggles with is basements. She is absolutely terrified of basements. We don't have a basement at home, but we're isolating with my parents right now and our room is downstairs. We've been carrying her down the stairs at night and giving her love and treats when we get her down there. This morning my wife and mom and I were hanging out downstairs and Maggie was at the top whining because she wanted to be near us but she was afraid. We just ignored her and let her work it out herself, and after about 10 minutes she came downstairs all by herself!! She was so proud of herself! We've only had her about 6 months and she's come such a long way. Omg I love her to pieces she is such a good girl. [Maggie](https://imgur.com/a/QyTWLfW)

Edit: thank you so so much everyone!!! I cannot believe this little post got so much love. Thanks for all the awards, I'm honestly floored. I can't keep up with all the comments but I read and appreciate them all! By request, here are [more pics](https://m.imgur.com/a/SOWZxT9) of my sweet girl. (My phone was glitching so bad when I tried to delete the last one so just please pardon the pic of my hand, I didn't mean to select it) 

Maggie wants to lick each of your faces and she says she will get to all of you tomorrow. If you haven't received your face lick by Monday please let her know, she doesn't want to miss anyone.Social distancing can create new relationships as well. 

There was an old lady living next door to me. She was always complaining about something. We are to loud, my daughter is bringing in dirt to the staircase, were sitting on the balcony late evenings etc. 

Since now we are all time at home we sit a lot during the day on the balcony next to this lady. She's almost always there. Just sitting and staring at the patio. 

Two weeks ago I was like - damn, i dont like her, but its a special situation, so I asked her if she needs some groceries. And then i saw the change on her face. 

She wasn't annoying and complaining. She was LONLEY! 

Since then my daughter and her became besties. Sitting for hours on two different balconies and doing all sorts of shit like playing memory, storytelling, doing food for each other... But the way my daughter and this lady smile at each other each morning while saying hi is priceless.  

Amazing stuff. She turned out to be a great person and cannot wait for covid to be gone and to have a dinner together. 

We lived next door for 3 years and we needed covid to make things up for us. 


Just saying that social distancing can result in social bounding :)There's this stray cat that I've been feeding for the past few weeks on my way to school. Well, today while i was playing with it, a kid bumped his little remote control toy car on my leg, idk why but it startled me, i guess the cat saw this as a threat to me and started attacking the car. I felt very proud.

That's all. Fin!








EDIT: The reason i haven't adopted the cat is because of money. It's a stray cat so I can't just take him in, I'd have to take him to the vet and buy him cat food on a regular basis. Till now I've been giving him some meat from my lunch and buying him some milk from my lunch money.

But maybe I'll talk to my brother about it, we might adopt him if he approves.



EDIT 2: And yes, thanks to you guys, i now know i shouldn't be giving him milk. Thanks for all the advices, appreciate it.My girlfriend had a limited edition facial moisturiser she LOVED and her last one ran out and she got kinda upset about it.

Managed to track down two bottles of it (double retail price!!) and I can’t wait to surprise her with one of them when I can see them again.

Then a couple months down the line when she’s run out of it again and bummed out I can surprise her with the second one and hopefully see her face light up 

Idk Why I’m excited about it but I can’t tell her and my friends would just call me sappyI’m usually really hard on myself so I’m struggling to recognise the hard work that’s gone into getting this far. It would be nice for someone to say they’re proud of me I guess

Edit: thank you so so SO much everyone, this response has been incredible! I’m trying my best to read and reply to everyone because it really does mean the world to me but they’re coming in faster than I can type (which is fantastic!). Thank you all!

Update: finished my first exam with a 93% mark, thank you everyone for believing in me!1) Helps my self confidence. I have to worry less about if I look ugly or not and am more outgoing.

2) let's you know if your breath smells bad

3) Keeps my face warm when I walk into freezing cold weather

4) Makes me feel like a weeb ninja

5) Provides a small amount of protection from general droplet infections. ( I haven't caught common cold since covid started)

EDIT: Thank you all for the awards. Very kind but quite undeserved; I was just sharing some fun quirks of wearing masks.Me and my two year old signed our lease today. I am soo proud of myself. After 4 months of being in a shelter we made it out. It has been rough, plenty of tears, blood, sweat , and just pure chaos. God truly watched over us. This is the best Christmas gift I could have ever asked for. My little one is sound asleep in my lap as I type this ❤️ thanks for listening.

Edit: Omgoodness I have absolutely no words for all the kind comments I have received. I am just waking up in the US/Virginia. I am a single mom with a two year old.
Thanks for the silver and gold, I’ve never felt such praise from kind strangers. Also sorry to ask for prayers a s I know some people are not religious, I myself am fighting with that at times. But the universe has definitely smiled down on us this Christmas. I will never forget the struggle & I am very proud of all my hard work, it has been HARD! Everyone please enjoy your holidays and be grateful for the little things.I was bullied very traumatically when I was 12. I lived in a small town. In grade 6, for all intents and purposes I was 'cool' and fit in and was embraced by the bulk of my class, "dated" a popular boy, went to parties we'd take turns throwing in our parents' basements (dance mix '96, anyone?)

The next year, without rhyme or reason I was suddenly targeted/alienated/manipulated by all of my old 'popular' friends, almost methodically torn-down. Notes were passed about me, right in front of me, no matter what I wore or did with my hair, I was told I looked stupid/ugly. When I tried to stand up for myself I was mocked. I was prank-called on 'three-way' with people listening in. I started missing field trips, went home for lunch, I even stayed home from school on a few occasions. It was a miserable time for me.  

One guy in particular, whom I had been very close to prior, (we'd been 'best friends,' talking on the phone for hours and hours at a time, we'd even shared a kiss on my driveway that past summer) he turned like a rattlesnake. He ran with the new dynamic like it was his job. Almost seemed to be perpetuating it as it progressed.

After maybe 6 months of this, I eventually was embraced/taken in by a small circle of girls. We needed to get into groups of four for a project and they very graciously invited me into their group after nobody else would. They were sort of 'neutral' in terms of social-standing, or whatever one would call the dumb hierarchy in elementary schools/classrooms. They were not involved in the bullying, and I didn't really know them well. 

After I grew closer to this little group and formed new friendships, the bullying slowly began to have much less of an impact on me until it all but ceased. I moved away from that town about three years later. (I'm still friends with those girls, I should add.)

This guy though, the particularly awful one, he reached out to me yesterday morning. Said he'd been 'following' me on social media for years. He said he'd asked old classmates about me. Told me I had no idea how often he'd thought about me over the years. Even lightly joked that he didn't want to 'get creepy' about it. 

He said he owed me an apology; that I was an 'amazing and gorgeous woman,' that he was sick over how he'd treated me. He said he was shaking as we spoke. 

He said he was so happy for me, so happy to see how well I seemed to be doing. He asked if we could keep talking, and I said probably not. I said I was a little thrown for a loop, but I thanked him for reaching out and apologizing all the same.

He seemed so sincere, but the entire thing kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. It didn't feel as vindicating as one would imagine when fantasizing about such a scenario. 

He doesn't live anywhere near me, so I don't think he has ulterior motives, but I can't help but feel jaded and dubious. 

And on top of that, it kind of just brought a lot of it back and I found myself feeling very flat and ruminating on it all way more than I cared to all of yesterday. 

I even dug out my diary from that year and found his name came up a lot in various melodramatic "this was the worst day of my life" styles of entries. 

I guess I've not quite unpacked it fully, but for some odd reason, I can't help but feel a bit emotionally inconvenienced by all of this.  

Have any of guys been contacted by a former bully? Have any of you been a former bully and apologized? 

For those who have read this long-winded ramble, thank you. 

Tl;dr: former bully who did a number on my self-esteem contacted me with not only an apology, but a lot of praise, and almost seemed to express some sort of feelings for me (?)

Edit: You all are very kind, thank you. This has been very helpful/validating. I was wondering if I was silly getting stuck on something that had taken place so long ago, but no, that shit stays with people.Not out of any real choice on the matter, I promise. I'm just poor and don't get paid until the end of the month. I have milk that's two weeks expired because I'm also apparently too depressed to put energy into throwing it away.
But I've been craving some good old honey nut cheerios and eating them dry just isn't the same. I figured if I needed something wet I could at least try water. It couldn't be that bad.

It was that bad.

On first spoonful, I realized with horror that every iota of flavor had been washed away by the hydrating menace. The speed with which water sucks the fun out of everything is truly astounding.
On the second taste, my disappointment skyrocketed. The cheerios were already turning soggy. Honestly I might as well have decided to chew on wet cardboard for breakfast.

As like any superhero, I endured. The entire bowl was consumed despite my taste buds screaming to me that I was eating nothing but dripping wet air. 
Lo and behold, as I stared down at the leftover water with pure, seething hatred, I saw it. There was a brownish hue. The flavor had vanished into the pits of a cursed bowl. 
I thought that perhaps a sip would allow me to have a taste of the honey goodness I craved. 

It was not meant to be.

The water was not flavored. Rather, it held the memory of a smell of flavor. I was disgusted by this turn of events. My faith was again dashed across the windshield and left to bake in the scorching sun. 

I ask you, where did the flavor go? In what multiverse can I find it again?

The entire experience was tasteless and altogether terrible. It will do of you're desperate for wet cereal, but be prepared for the consequences my friends. He had a friend over, they interacted well, he listened and verbalized his thoughts/opinions throughout the day, and did not have a single behavioral moment all day.  It was a huge win and I am proud of him and just wanted to shout it to the void.

Edit:. Wow!  Thanks for all the gold/silver/comments.  It's been fun continuing to celebrate the success of Saturday throughout Sunday with nonstop notifications!So I (16f: changed from 15f because i keep forgetting i’m 16 since my birthday recently) absolutely suck ass at cooking, and over the past few days i've wanted to get better at it, with the help of my mom. a few days ago we made pasta, and I asked my mom if she thought my dad would like it, and she said he doesn't like pasta. My dad doesn't seem to like alot of things, he's a heavy smoker and alot of stuff just doesn't taste good to him. I felt really bad since my dad works practically all day and has to come home to just scrambled eggs usually , so i went up to him that day and asked him what he DOES like. he listed things like potatoes and vegetables. so i made it my mission to make a meal that he likes. today, i was trying to decide what i would make, and remembered my mission, and decided on potato wedges with cooked vegetables and a homemade sauce. I made it pretty much only because i wanted him to eat it, and the entire time i was making it i couldn't sit still i was so excited to give it to him. well he came home, I made him his coffee and gave him his dish, and he said it looked delicious. a little while later after i gave my brother his plate, i went to my dad and asked him how it was, and he said he loved it. I looked at my mom with a dumbass grin on my face and said "you hear that??" 

Now i'm in my room eating my plate and i couldn't be happier, i almost want to cry. My wonderful dad doesn't get really good food most of the time (my mom's really busy alot) and seeing his face as he ate what i made for him makes me want to make dinner alot more around here!

Edit: JESUS CHRIST i just woke up and there’s so many comments, i tried to answer as many as i could, and im so glad you guys liked it :))When I spiral, I spiral hard. Ever since the quarantine, I had been feeling down, my house had turned into a dump and I spent all my time gaming and not taking care of myself, but today I said fuck all that, Woke up at 6am and got my shit together. I feel great now and just wanted to share this with someone. Thank you for listening :)He checked all the sales, even going back and forth to different stores to compare prices. He got everything he needed, and saved a small portion so we could have lunch together after. When I apologized for not being able to afford as much this year, he cracked a joke, then said "Mom, I see how hard you and Dad are trying. I'm thankful for what you were able to give me and just wish I could help out." We had such a nice day together, I went from feeling awful and like a shit parent to feeling so proud and loved. I feel stupid. I always thought it was just kind of a joke. But I was watching Downton Abbey and it was used in what i now realize is the actual meaning. If A says "see you" and B says "not if I see you first", B is implying that upon seeing A, B will get the hell out of there so they wont have to interact.

Is this common knowledge that I was just a total idiot in missing?

Edit: okay good, I definitely wasn't the only person who didn't realize this(27, F, NZ)

I've known for over a decade that i'm anemic. It didnt feel like a big deal because it never prevented me from doing the things i wanted to do. 

I took Iron and Vitiam C supplements for a while but they made me feel sick so decided not to bother. 
Yeah, I require more sleep then most people but I exercise often, eat reasonably well, and consider myself healthy.

Recently, I had laproscopic surgery and the doctor (after seeing my blood results) scheduled me in for a fully funded Iron transfusion.

Iron deficiency occurs when the body doesn’t have enough of the mineral iron. This leads to abnormally low levels of red blood cells. That’s because iron is needed to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen around the body.

The transfusion experience took about 2 hours and the iron felt cold when it entered my vein. I didnt feel anything at first but then later on that day, I almost choked on oxygen. It was like a double breath, a breath straight after another breath and it was completely involuntarily. 

It confused me at first but then I quickly realised I could suddenly breathe twice as deep as I could before - without even trying! When I try take a big breath now, it feels like I can inhale more oxygen than my ribcage can hold.

Its crazy that I never knew, I was living with shortness of breath for so many years. So to celebrate, I sat outside in the cold winter air, just enjoying breathing at full capacity. 
 
What a beautiful gift I was given.Edit: Woman, not girl.

I separated from ex-wife last year and divorced earlier this one. We were together 10 years. It was one of the hardest points of my life.

I struggled a lot with feeling I was unlovable or broken or a bad partner. I’ve spent a ton of time working with my therapist to grow and deal with these feelings. Today, I’m a generally pretty happy and confident person.

But I still struggle a bit with physical contact. I can have a great date, but as soon it is nearing the end I stutter and stumble over my words. 

I’ve been talking to this one girl for three months. It’s been moving really slowly because of COVID. We are both careful. Today was our third date. It went really well. At the end, I was awkward as expected and she still wanted to kiss me. It was great. First time I’ve kissed someone in a year. And she’s a great person. I’m really happy right now.So after a night out on the town, my fiancee and I are heading back home on the train ( at 1am)  when we spot 4 drunk guys. Ok fine whatever. Then we spot 2  17/18 year olds who who were both drunk. The four guys then started eyeing up these girls on the train. I stepped in and asked if they would join us. We basically spoke to them and assured them that all was ok.

The kicker to this whole story was that as we escorted the girls to their taxi from the train station, the four guys had been following them and seemed quite pissed that they were gone.

My fiance gave me a hug and said Im bad ass. Feeling very manly right now.

Edit 1: Thank you so much for your responses! I'm overwhelmed. I'm the guy in the story. My Fiancee is a badass too! She deserves credit as well.

Edit 2: Holy Moly, this blew up! Thank you for all your kind words and the awards. I will try respond and answer all replies when I can! 

Edit 3: Spelling.6 months ago I went through a horrible breakup. As I was walking into the apothecary in the mall, the employee saw me crying my eyes out, and she proceeded to give me a beautiful crystal stone. 

Yesterday the person in front of me paid for my Starbucks food. 

And today an employee gave me free fries because he felt bad that I had to wait a couple extra minutes 

These seemingly little acts of kindness give me so much motivation and I inch towards philanthropy every time they happen. Even intangible acts like a smile or sharing a laugh brightens my day so much 

If you are kind to others, thank you. It can mean the world to anotherAlright, this is what I want you to do:

In present day, pick a spot that is special to you (your favorite seat in the livingroom, a bench at a park, etc) that you want to use as an anchor. Invest in a GOOD 360 VR camera. I want you to take that camera and put it in your anchor spot. Record in that spot for 2-3 hours. Nothing has to happen, just record. Then in 30 years when you start to forget what your first apartment looked like, you could pick up a flash drive, pop on a vr headset, and go back.  

That's just the tipping point. If you want to put more effort into it, you can walk in and talk to future you, have a conversation (obviously pretty one-sided). Or set the camera up, turn on Netflix, and marathon your favorite show with YOUNGER you. How cool would that be?

If you want to get advanced you can bring people in on it. Whenever you set up your camera, tell everyone that it is you from the future. What is time travel really? If you believe that time is linear and that the past can't be changed, then you ARE in fact time traveling. Especially if people are interacting with you (you just have a weird robot camera body and cant speak) 

Take it a step further for your kids. When you have a teenager who knows everything and thinks you are too old to get it. Give them a VR headset and let them hang out with younger you for a little bit. Younger you (present you) can give them advice that they might take more to heart. 

How enjoyable of an experience depends on how much effort you put into it. And there you go, you just learned how to time travel.A friend of mine knows I make songs as a hobby, so he took some songs I sent him and went through all of the administrative headache of submitting them to Spotify, and yesterday I woke up to a text of him sending me a link telling me to check out a song he liked, so I opened it and there I was !

I know everyone can be on Spotify if they ask to be but man ngl it feels so surreal seeing my name in a context where I'm used to see artists I look up to, it feels like such an exclusive closed environment that I'm still not used to being on it. Can't do enough justice to how great of a birthday gift it was :DI’ve never held a child in my life - I’m always afraid that I’m going to do something wrong, like pick them up too fast or drop them. I’m not sure where this fear originated but it’s so severe, I haven’t ever played with kids (except when I was a kid, obviously). Also, my own childhood was rocky so I’ve never really trusted myself to be able to handle something as important and precious as a child.

Two days ago, an old friend of mine and her husband brought their daughter to our apartment complex to swim. Their daughter is only 3 years old and I kept my distance for a while. Then she wanted me to catch her as she jumped (very small height from a concrete step inside the pool). I couldn’t say no so I just made myself catch her. 

We spent hours in that pool and she just kept… trusting me, 100%. I even had her grab onto my shoulders and I swam across the top of the water with her. It was endlessly fun and I felt just full of this childhood joy I haven’t felt in so long. 

Yesterday, my sister tells me that our friend’s husband had sent her a message on Facebook. He told her that their daughter had so much fun and couldn’t stop talking about us, but especially me. Me! I’m tearing up just writing this. I just have this whole new outlook on life now for some reason and I can’t stop smiling about it.

EDIT: Um, wow! I went to sleep with around 10 upvotes and y’all skyrocketed this to nearly 10,000! So many comments, too 😅 I’m going to try my hardest to reply to each and every one of you! Also, I know Reddit gets annoyed by this, but I really do want to thank those who gave me silver / gold. I totally didn’t anticipate this, but wow!i was put on furlough due to covid and i used this time to finally finish my high school diploma which i've been ignoring for three years. 

i'm 21F and throughout high school i had pretty bad anxiety and depression. i was also distracted by a really unhealthy relationship and didn't take myself or my education seriously. i basically stopped going to school my senior year and i failed. i've been signed up with an adult learning program in my city since 2017 to help me finish. but between working full time and getting mental health support - my education fell through the cracks. 

i feel so free now. i didn't realize how much this affected me. there's nothing weighing me down anymore! i'm kinda mad at myself for taking this long to complete it but now i have a huge appetite for motivation and getting shit done. 

i also hid this from my family and friends so i can't really outwardly celebrate it. but i don't care i'm going to bake myself something nice, have a beer and post about it into the endless void of reddit. thanks for reading 💓

edit: i cannot believe i came back to so many people congratulating me. i love this sub and all the people in it! i'm happy to make you all proud 🥺❤️I have been working harder to have better sounding papers, and its paying off. She pulled me aside and said she loves my writing style and she read my paper twice cause it was so beautiful and i should consider publishing it in our college paper. I'm just really happy cause it was a personal paper. We had to reflect on our sense of place and home, which is a difficult topic for me as I didn't always feel loved at home and drive thousands of miles a year for school. I'm a junior in college now and it just really felt nice to get that positive of a reaction towards something I created.

Thanks for listening, much loveI've exercised on and off for the past 5 or so years, but I've never been very consistent. Aside from staving off quarantine blues a little bit (which is a very happy side effect) being forced to stay home all day has kept me very consistent with exercising. I'm up 30 pounds from 120lb(!), I'm eating healthy and I feel good about myself. I know 3 months isn't much in the grand scheme of things, but it's a start I'm very happy with.

I hope this didn't come across as overly self-serving, I'm just happy with myself and wanted to put it out there somewhere. Thanks for reading :)I went to sign in and the gentleman in front of me was being rude to you. You snapped back at him for having an attitude. As another healthcare professional, I felt that. People can be so unpleasant at times. 
I signed in and patiently waited in my car for over an hour until you called me.
I came in, sat down, you swabbed my nose. Maybe I'm a baby but it did not feel very nice at all, but that's  ok. I expected it to be uncomfortable.
Then, by accident of course, you dropped my sample. The look of horror in your eyes. You apologized and told me you would have to do it again. I wasn't mad. I just laughed it off, "Oh it's ok, it didn't hurt at all." You felt really bad but I promise it was ok, we are human and accidents happen.
I hope you are having the best day, thank you for risking your health to test/help others.I've been suffering from baldness for probably a good 6 years or so, however the last couple years have been a clear indication that it was going to happen soon.

I attempted to grow the hair long however it would always look obvious that I was attempting to cover the baldness (front to the crown) and then I'd attempt to have it short but then it wouldn't look ideal. 

Many photos later and I hated it. Everyday I tried to move hair over to cover it up but the moment you'd stand up or go outside it just put it back to where it should be. 

Thankfully, today with the push from my fantastic partner my clippers arrived and I said lets do it. Took a couple of attempts at a longer length but gradually got to 3mm (1 all over) and I've never been so happy. Sure, I still have parts of my hair that are thinner - I can actually see I **have hair there** it's just incredibly thin and fine, but now the rest of the hair has been shaved it blends in.

I've never been so happy. Is going to take a while to get used to, but I've had such an incredible response from my family and friends it's just a small but very significant change. 

My advice - fuck what other people say and do what makes you happy. I've said that to everyone else but never took my own advice. Now I have.

EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone for their kind words. The more I think about this the more I think it was really getting to me. Additionally, thank you so much for the Gold Award.

EDIT: Woah. What a crazy experience reading comments with everyone sharing their personal stories. Fantastic! Just woke up since last and for the first time in years feel like I could go straight out the house without jumping in the shower to wet my hair and try sort it out..what a crazy thought 🤷🏻‍♂️ Appreciate all the support and I’m glad everyone has been so kind to everyone that’s posted. This has blown up like crazy and I thank you for the rewards! 😬I hadn't really studied much and my PSAT scores have ranged from about 1250 to 1310. But after I took the SAT about a month ago, I found out recently that I got a 1430 and I'm in the 98th percentile! I looked online and I've done well enough to go to UPenn (which is where I'd like to go for my major). I'm pretty proud of myself.I wasn’t sure where to post this. When I was in 6th or 7th grade, I got dehydrated during football practice. After the first instance, it began occurring fairly regularly, even though I had increased the amount of water I’d drink throughout the day. I ended up seeing a doctor, who told me I just needed to make sure I was staying hydrated and to, quote, “touch a salt shaker once or twice a day.” 

So, every day for the last 12-13 years, I’ve always made a point of quite literally touching a salt shaker at least once. Not using the salt shaker (unless I’m cooking dinner I don’t usually salt things). 

Today, a friend and I were out to lunch and he saw me tap the salt shaker. He has since made me feel like a moron.My Dad is a great guy. He’s had a bit of a rough go in the last few years with some unfortunate events in his life, but that’s never changed how wonderful he is. I don’t really get to know what happens between him and his students at work, and he’s a researcher and professor for a university in my state, so that side of him has always been a bit unknown to me. I discovered Rate My Professor recently when starting to sign up for college courses, and randomly decided to look him up.

His students love him. He has a perfect score with 15+ reviews, and the reviews are nothing but praise. I’ve read all of them, and it makes me so happy to see that people enjoy my Dad as much as I do.

Honestly, I just wanted to tell someone about it, I haven’t felt this amount of genuine happiness in a long time, and this was the only place I could think of.

EDIT: It was late last night when I posted, but I finally had a chance to talk to my Dad about what I saw. I asked him if he had any idea what his students thought about him on Rate My Professor, and he told me that he’d always been too afraid to look, which to me, btw, is hilarious, because I felt a little nervous when looking at them too. I guess we’re the same in that regards.

I told him about his reviews, and about how much people liked him, and he seem surprised. He mentioned that he thought people only left a review on that site once they had a bad experience, not to just compliment a professor they like, and when I told him he had a perfect score, he started laughing.

He told me, “I’m really glad people enjoy my class. It’s something I’m incredibly glad I got to start doing when we moved here, and it’s something that brings me a lot of joy”. We moved about the same time my Dad started teaching on campus, which would be about four years ago, so he is still somewhat fresh into the system.

I told him about how happy and proud it made me to see so many people say so many good things about him and he smiled, and responded with “I’ve heard there’s another website that ranks Professors attractiveness; I wonder what score I have on there?”. Classy.

Anyways, thank you to the people that recommended me talk to my Dad, and thanks to the people that could share in a happy moment of mine.I got a new fridge and was so excited about it. It’s larger than my old one, has so much more freezer space; I’ve never been this excited about a fridge. Well today I dropped an ice cube on the floor and my lazy ass doesn’t wanna pick it up, so I kick it: it bounces straight off. “Huh?” I bend down to investigate. Lo and behold, there’s a guard to keep things from sliding under it. Now I have to pick up my dropped ice cubes... like the adult I am... *sigh*That's pretty cool to realize. I finally have my own space and won't be taking up anybody else's space.

I can do what I want, when I want.

I don't have to worry about losing it, unless I lose my job. It's nice

Edit: I definitely didn't expect this to blow up. Thank you to everyone and thanks for the coins!Hello, I’m Phoenix and I’m 16 years old. I will be trick or treating this year as I do every year because I love doing it, love candy, and love chaperoning for my younger siblings. 


In the past two years when I’ve gone trick or treating, I’ve always gotten the side eye or some adults telling me I was too old to be out. Not in a joking way either- just telling me I had no business being out trick or treating. 


I’m on the shorter side and depending on lighting I can look older or younger than I am. I’ve had many people tell me I look older than I am and some people telling me I look younger. But that’s not my point.


You never know why someone is out trick or treating. You never know if it’s their favorite holiday, if their home life is stable, if they’re chaperoning, if they’ve had anything to eat that day, etc etc. 


So please, if you buy candy to give out for trick or treaters, be prepared to give it to anyone who comes to your door in costume and saying trick or treat. I don’t care if it’s a four year old or a grown adult. It’s one night of the year and typically lasts from anywhere from two to four hours. 


I’m not asking you to go out and buy the whole supermarket. Just buy what you want and give it to whoever. I’m also not asking you to give entire buckets to people. Just be considerate - who cares if a teenager comes to your door? They could be out drinking or smoking, as is what Happens at most Halloween parties. Instead they’re doing something harmless and safe. 


You don’t have to be extremely kind, but please be *considerate*. 


Thank you, and have a wonderful Halloween.5 years ago, I didn’t know who Beyoncé was (I am very very uncultured with pop culture) but I did know that name existed since, you know... she’s famous. Just didn’t know it was the name of a person. 

It did rhyme with *fiancé* and not many words rhyme with that, so I thought a fiancé was what you call a woman who is engaged, and a beyoncé was a man who is engaged. 

I learned many things that year.I have had my same cell number for 13 years. In the last two years, I have started to receive a ton of calls asking to speak to customer service/AT&T. In the beginning, I was super annoyed and I thought someone was prank calling me. I started to pay attention to the calls and I realized that it was always senior citizens (but never the same one). 

One day a lady left a lengthy voicemail for her doctor. She shared a lot of information and she desperately needed a reply. I felt horrible for her, so I called her back. I wanted her to know that she had called the wrong number. I did not want her to be waiting for a reply from her doctor that would never come (assuming that was the only call she made). She told me about how her husband had recently died and how he had been “the one who knew how to use the Internet.” She told me she was using a phone book from the 90s and it was very hard to read, even with her glasses. So I looked up her doctor’s number and sent her on her way. She was very grateful and it made me feel happy to help her. 

When the next call came, I did the same thing. I explained to this man that I didn’t work for AT&T, but I could give him the correct number. He thanked me and we had a casual conversation about how technology has changed so much in his lifetime. He told me about his childhood and that if someone had told him at age 10 that he’d be carrying a computer around in his hand someday, he would have punched them in the nose. Firstly because he didn’t know what a computer was, and, secondly, because, “that’s impossible.”  

I’ve continued to answer the calls and I’ve done the most random stuff for people. I’ve helped them order pizza online, I’ve looked up numbers for them, I’ve given restaurant recommendations based off my experiences and other experiences on Yelp, etc. Every single one of these people have been grateful for the help, and they’ve always wanted to chat a little longer. 

A lot of them have told me that once you get older, people don’t visit as much. They said they lose a lot of people, they become immobile, and the younger folks in their lives don’t have time to come see them as often as they would like. Because of this weird glitch, I have started a tradition of taking my kid to senior living homes every Christmas. We bake cookies, we spend the day there just chatting with folks, and then we go about our day. It’s not nearly enough, but I feel like we make a tiny difference. When he gets older and isn’t such a handful (not a toddler), I hope we can visit more often. 

My husband and I have done research to find what number these people are trying to call, but we haven’t found anything close. Neither has AT&T. It’s a mystery, but I’ll keep answering my calls. I love it.

Tl;dr: I get a lot of phone calls from random senior citizens who think they’re dialing AT&T’s customer service line. I used to get mad, but now I answer and help them however I can. It’s become one of my very favorite things. 

Edit: HOLY COW! I had no clue this would blow up like it did. Thank you so much for the gold, kind strangers! And thank you to everyone who stopped by and read my post. I wrote it last night when I couldn’t fall asleep, and I really never expected anyone to read it, haha. I’m trying to go through and reply to everyone. After all, I came for some casual conversation - it’s just taking me a little longer than I expected. You guys are great, I love your stories, please keep sharing them! My heart is so full today.

PS I feel like I should take the time to really encourage you to visit a local nursing home or call your older loved ones. There are so many wonderful people there and they’re full of so much information. It’s like talking to a real life history book. I promise you won’t regret it!

Have a super day, Reddit!

Edit 2: Wowza. I am so grateful for everyone sharing their stories with me. I’m trying to reply to everyone, but I’m just not as fast as you guys. I’ll keep replying, but it might take me a little while. I’ve got a toddler and he’s not understanding how cool this is! He’d rather just play cars. Thanks again for the gold and silver, kind strangers! You guys are the best. I’m a dishwasher currently and i make 12.75, but with taxes it’s like 9$ an hour. But i just a job as a dietary aide for an assisted living place, and i’m going to be making $16.75!  i’m so excited, and i had no one else to tell. I can choose how many days and hours i want to work, so I think i’m going to be working 15 hours a week.This is the best I have even done in my life,I struggle a lot with academics and I've never got more than B+. I worked so hard this time and the results came today . I'm so happy. I don't have many friends to tell this so I just want everyone to know. I'm so proud of myself that I topped in my class. I feel so relived.







Edit:Thanks for the wholesome award and silver,lovely strangers. And more thanks for the gold and all the other awards. You're all so kind and wonderful. You all have been so supportive and amazing. I never imagined that this would gain the attention that it did. I haven't been able to keep up with it,but I'll try to reply to every comment.


Thankyou

And other anonymous users 
For giving me awards.I’ve always been a depressive, leave-the-kitchen-dishes-to-rot-as-long-as-you-possibly-can, kinda gal. A barely functioning, I-have-awful-depression-and-want-to-die-most-of-the-time-and-I’m-exhausted-from-making-that-meal-so-I-have-NO-desire-to-attempt-to-clean-, kinda gal. 

I don’t know what came over me today, but after making a meal of sausages, potatoes and vegetables, I just decided to clean the dishes right now. No letting them fester. No piling dishes in the corner till I have no cutlery left. No weird smells here and there. No eating out of dirty bowls or reusing a spoon several times because it looks the least suspicious out of all the rest of the rotten spoons. 

I washed up my pans, cleaned the dishes and cutlery, and wiped down all kitchen surfaces. My kitchen looks fucking beautiful. And oh my god it’s going to be the best feeling walking into a clean and useable kitchen tomorrow?! 

This is so tiny and dumb but it feels like such a beautiful win right now, and I wanted to tell someone. I brushed my teeth and skipped myself to bed to type this. Go me!!!! Is this adulting ?!

EDIT: omg!! 100 comments?! THREE AWARDS? guys, I’ve never received an award before lol. Usually my posts don’t get any replies and I delete them all afterwards. Thanks so much for giving me tips and motivation. This has really, truly made my day. It’s 01:00 am where I am, but I’ll try and reply to everyone tomo! Loads of love!!

EDIT 2: I was falling asleep just hitting 900 upvotes, looking at this post when I woke up and seeing all the upvotes, awards and interactions has made me all teary lol. 
I can’t believe this random post has taken off like this. I just wanted to shout into the void that I’d washed my pans, and here all you guys are shouting back!!! Thank you so much. It feels lovely. 
Can’t wait to sit down with a tea and reply to every comment. Good morning from a very quiet and stormy coastal town in South England. 

EDIT 3: PS - walking into my clean kitchen has totally set me up for a positive day. I’d forgotten I’d done it, and the clean sides and clean sink are priceless. What a feeling.My roommate and I moved into an apartment for the semester and they, while not bad enough to be considered anorexic, still have a hard time with undereating. The first week, they ate 4 times. Last week they said they weren't hungry so I thought of that as an opportunity to be creative in the kitchen so I wouldn't be worried about things they are picky about and I knew I could make something for them if they changed their mind. I went to a local asain market and grabbed some quick items to make some lo mein because it's easy and really tasty. I get back and they still say they aren't hungry so I start making the lo mein. Near the end of cooking they come in remarking about how it smells really good. I offer to serve them a portion but they maintain that they weren't hungry. I still serve a small portion for them and they agree to taste it. They ended up going for seconds without hesitation and were amazed that I got them to eat veggies. Overall that encounter really was a big confidence boost when it comes to my skills in the kitchen and makes me happy that maybe I can help my roommate develop a healthier relationship with food.I found out that my job’s contract will likely not be renewed for next year on Friday. It was a wild year with a crazy admin who makes a lot of cuts so while it wasn’t the biggest surprise, it was still upsetting. Ended up crying to both parents on the phone, mostly my mom. Towards the end I said something like “ugh, I really want Panera soup, but they don’t deliver and I cannot fathom driving 20 minutes there and back right now.” (It was a long day for multiple reasons, and I love Panera‘s creamy tomato soup as comfort food that fits my gluten free needs!) I ordered other food that night and thought I’d treat myself to soup another day.

Saturday at around 1 PM I get a call. “Hey, it’s Dad. I know I should have called to make sure it was okay, but I’m here. Outside of your apartment building. I picked up some Panera but I’m happy to drop it off and leave. I just know you wanted soup.”

I obviously welcomed him upstairs and he stayed the night. Turns out his plan was to drop it off with my doorman, and text me saying he ordered it from Panera and paid an extra $15 for them to make the delivery, so I would have never known he made the drive.

His plan was literally to drive a combined 8+ hours from NYC to Boston and back just to drop off soup and a salad. Because his daughter had a bad day.

My dad rocks.

Edit: thanks for all the love, kind comments, and anecdotes! Totally didn’t expect this to blow up. Made my night to read all of these messages. I teared up at some of your stories. Much love to you all.

Edit 2: turns out I wasn’t non-renewed, but I am hoping to leave the job now anyway as I had already started seeking new opportunities. Hope to move closer to my family and can do so on my own terms. Onward and upward!Update at bottom!! Our 4 year anniversary is in a couple weeks, and we just found out I’m somehow pregnant last week. We tried for three years, with fertility treatments and four miscarriages. All unexplained, with no idea why I couldn’t get or stay pregnant. We stopped trying a year ago and had made the best of life with the two of us and our four fur babies. Now out of the blue, I’m pregnant and so far it seems like this one might actually work. It’s still very early and we have our first ultrasound tomorrow. I’m hoping things go well. My husband is always the ultimate optimist and has full faith and confidence in me, us, this pregnancy...you name it, he’s sure it’s going to work out :) 


Enter the bedtime book. The other day he was on Amazon looking at Dr. Seuss, Winnie the Pooh, and so on. I forgot about it until today when a package showed up. It’s the complete tales of Winnie the Pooh! I cried (lots of emotions and hormones) but really it was such a sweet gesture. Best hubby ever and would make a great dad if that ever happens. 


I hope everyone has someone like that in your life. A cheerleader, an optimist, a planner, a best friend. Someone to pull you along and up when life is crapping on you. If you’ve made it this far, please keep your fingers crossed for us tomorrow. Thanks!


EDIT- I cried so much and then showed my hubby when he got home. Thank you reddit for helping me find all the words to tell him how much I appreciate him!! I’ll post an update on this tomorrow. Fingers crossed :)


In the meantime, some of you have suggested other books for future reading. I’d love to hear about more of your favorites! Thanks again for making our night better.


EDIT- UPDATE!! We got a baby with a heartbeat!!! Everything looked perfect, we were told all measurements are great, good strong heartbeat, and...we shouldn’t worry. Ha. Of course I’m going to worry! It felt so unreal. My husband went from patting me on the head because I was worried to half-smacking my arm in excitement saying “baby with a heartbeat! We got a baby with a heartbeat!!” 😂 there were some tears. The tech was very understanding. I’ll post again if/when we have more to update in the coming weeks or months. Wheeeee!!


On a funny side note, we’d told our close friend about the appointment today. She showed up to our celebratory dinner with a book for baby bean!! It’s called “Press Here” and will be great for learning. So now our bean has TWO books, soon to be followed by many more from your wonderful suggestions below. 


Thanks again for all the support and well wishes!!! We waited a full hour to be seen today, which we spent reading through all your wonderful comments. You definitely helped ease my stress during what was surely one of the longest hours in the world lol. Thank you so much!!Idk I'm just kinda sitting here and having occasional bites of bread. It's pretty great. I'm also on vacation in North Carolina  and I could go out swimming in my pool but I'm just eating some bread and chilling.

update: not my video but watch it now  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZkSyg0X3Pw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZkSyg0X3Pw)I know it’s probably because I’m using this app toooooo dang much, but I just see the same shit over and over again even though I refresh my Home feed. Would be cool if there was a little button that could eliminate already viewed posts. Even reposts. 

Also, does anyone else curate their Home feed to only show your hobbies, wholesome things, cute animals, etc? It’s made my life a lot better on Reddit, although I suppose that’s why I’m seeing a lot of repeats. I’ll take that over incessant, depressing news and people getting hurt or beat up.I have always loved the dark atmosphere before a storm or when its cloudy and dark with a breeze. It always evokes some sort of emotions that i don’t feel anywhere else.I started tracking my weight in February, and got serious about losing it around mid-April. I’ve lost 25lbs. My scale has an app with a little chart of normal, overweight, obese. Today is the day I crossed from obese to overweight on that little chart.  In your face, scale app!

About 35lbs to go to “normal”. See you in a few months.In primary school I was bullied everyday by this guy, once he even pulled my pants down in front of the whole class (I still cringe about that)

But recently I crossed paths with him and he was such a nice guy, he was genuinely happy to see me and wanted to hang out and even said sorry for bullying me all those years ago. I looked him up on facebook and damn the dude is doing so much volunteer and charity work and he posts a lot of inspirational stuff on his page. Solid dude and such a great redemption arc. Keep it up brother!I try to avoid people mostly and don’t talk to anyone much but she was sweet and it blew my mind the close mindedness that still exists and the rude af behavior of people. Just be nice damnit we are all human regardless of what we look like or how we identify.

UPDATE: I just saw her AGAIN at the bus plaza and she gave me hugs and was talking about her day 😆
She was in a great mood, happy she just got some cute shoes at goodwill. Sparkly little sandalsI was eating lunch at a local small restaurant. There is usually only one waiter who I'm pretty sure is the son of the owner.  This guy at the table across from me was eating in workout clothes and didn't look like he had a wallet. After eating he got up and left without looking at the check. It sat there for a long time. When the waiter walked by, he just shook his head sadly when he saw the guy was gone.  I waited until the waiter was in the back, then slipped some cash into the check folder and went back to my table. 

The waiter came back and looked at the check in confusion. Then he went to the window to see if the guy was walking away after coming back. He went to the bathroom to see if he was in there. I was smiling at this point because I thought it would be a mystery to the waiter forever. Then he went over to the register and pulled up the security camera. Busted.

EDIT: I went back and [took a picture](https://imgur.com/6WzP30O)Which sounds like nothing, but if you've ever been on public transport, you'll know that everyone just tries to avoid causing trouble for themselves by awkwardly/begrudgingly putting up with disruptions.

However, this was wayyy too loud and too vulgar to ignore (was some super trashy and crude rap music). I decided to stop introverting and plucked up the courage to ask him politely to turn his music down.

He swore at me and walked off at the next stop and I thanked him for that, to which he threatened me to watch my back.

I don't care about empty threats and am just proud I did something like that and just wanted to share somewhere. Thanks for reading.

Edit: This, uh, blew up........ thank you for the gold kind strangers!I just got hired at kfc making a cool 10 bucks an hour baby!! I'm making those big bucks and the ladies cant get enough of me. It might seem lame but I'm soooooo happy and I feel like a god. Now I can save for a car and once that happens I can start achieving more :)___

I live in Central Texas and I've only been as far as CO for my honeymoon.  Recently divorced, and I had a realization yesterday.  I have nothing holding me down except for my decent paying job.  And family I guess, but there's only 5 of us left and we all live in a town of 4,000.

I love traveling and seeing my state, but after CO I realized that Texas doesn't have anything to it but history, and one huge mountain that I climbed a year ago.  After saving up some money I started hating the daily grind; working, sleeping, paying bills.  I wanted to shake things up.  Tomorrow night I'll be driving almost 24 hours, 2,000 miles north to Montana, my dream retirement home.  

I don't know what I'm going to do when I get there, or when I see a bear, but I'm extremely excited.  If the stars align in my favor, maybe I won't come back, we'll see ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I wasn't expecting this to gain any kind of traction at all, and I'm a little overwhelmed by everyone's kind words and advice, but I'm reading each reply and I appreciate everyone taking the time to contribute.  I've always been into driving long distances, but this'll be the farthest I've ever gone, let alone by myself.  A lot of you have gotten me a little nervous about being out of my element, but I'm more excited than anything.  I'm excited about taking a blind leap to the other side of the country, and I'm happy that you guys are happy alongside me. 

I'll be putting out updates every so often and a final update post later in the week.  I'm doing some maintenance on my ride to get it ready and then I'll be headed off to bed, ready to leave as soon as I get up.  Thank you guys for encouraging me as much as you have.  ~C.

___________________________________

6:39p - Just left my driveway. Dunno where I'll stop for the night, but I'd like to get out of Texas first. Not looking forward to the Amarillo highway, glad I got you guys with me. Well, [almost 2,000 miles](https://i.imgur.com/RuKuaUg.jpg)

8:45p - First gas station stop.  As a lot of commenters pointed out, never get below half a tank when you're doing distance driving.  I live by that advice and I've never once let my cars run out if I have a choice.  I'm [still in TX](https://i.imgur.com/z4gq5J3.jpg), it doesn't look like I've gone far. 

-Betting has officially begun-  Pothole pays 2 to 1, moose/deer pays 4 to 1, and a cannibalistic hitchhiker that eats my eyes pays 15 to 1; ***but*** he has to be an escaped convict serving no less than 30 years in prison.

10:45p - First actual rest stop.  Some random truck sleeping area [in the middle of nowhere](https://i.imgur.com/9xruE3L.jpg) near OK.  Gonna hit the road at 11.  Killing time setting playlists on Spotify and reading your comments.  If you guys have any playlists you wanna throw my way, I'm all ears.  My subs like electronic, not Skrillex or Daft Punk, but obscure artists like Ford., Purity Ring, Phantogram, Skott, or Flume.  Or any kind of rock or lesser known country.

11:53p - Just a quick one.  The windfarms are hands down the creepiest fucking thing I've ever seen on this god forsaken highway.  Just one minute you're [driving along,](https://i.imgur.com/cuqzB4G.jpg) and then [bam](https://i.imgur.com/2W0GB4Z.jpg), hundreds of autonomous blades the size of buildings, blinking in cold, unfeeling unison. It's fucking creepy.

[12:37a](https://i.imgur.com/9K065gX.jpg) - 6 hours in still haven't hit Amarillo yet.  Super quiet on the road, only a handful of trucks I've seen so far.  Stuck with one truck for a good while and finally passed him up, and he turned off his highbeams so he didn't blind me.  I communicate **alot** with my car, so I flashed my blinkers once to thank him, got a half mile i  front of him and flashed again, which he immediately knew to turn his brights back on.  It's odd to be completely alone, but still be in tune with randos around you.  I love people sometimes.

[3:40a](https://i.imgur.com/55Mm20r.jpg) - Had to get off the road for a bit.  Also decided to get some Whataburger before I left Texas, what can I say?  Also realised I've taken cruise control for granted my whole life.  I drive a Cruze with no cruise. Figure that.  My foot hurts like a mf.

[6:10a](https://i.imgur.com/FLtz13R.jpg) - After almost 12 whole hours, I finally [got the hell out](https://i.imgur.com/CLcU0aX.jpg).  It's actually flown by tbh which I'm grateful for.  The hardest part's over!

7:26a - Gonna be a nice [sunrise](https://i.imgur.com/CE1c44L.jpg)

8:05a - Welp, the gravity of the trip [just set in,](https://i.imgur.com/YKiJN0P.jpg) and I think I'm even more pumped now.   It was also a [gorgeous sunrise](https://i.imgur.com/fUmuWi7.jpg) in case you were wondering

[8:50a](https://i.imgur.com/F963Ljk.jpg) - Just got into CO, and already [struck in admiration. ](https://i.imgur.com/KtHHNdQ.jpg)  New Mexico came and went, only stopped to fill up and there was a nice old lady behind the register watching tv on one of those tiny 10" plastic tvs she was so cute

[10:44a](https://i.imgur.com/U24YBMZ.jpg) - [They should've sent a poet.](https://i.imgur.com/X7PrBsm.jpg) They didn't though, they sent me.  That shit's purdy, bro.

3:07p - Made it to Wyoming, and I love the simplicity of it's beauty.  Miles and miles of [snowy, rolling hills](https://i.imgur.com/yWXxgCB.jpg).  I swear I've dreamt of this place before when I was a kid.  Just something about it makes me feel like I belong here.  You guys are gorgeous, Wyoming.   As some of you pointed out, along with every sign I've seen on the road, y'all are getting some snow tomorrow.  I haven't seen any big Walmarts, or rest stops that allow overnight camping so I booked a cheap hotel for the night and we'll see what happens tomorrow. ✌

6:21p - Fun story, since we're talking about snow storms.  [That](https://i.imgur.com/frtu3CY.jpg) shit [blew](https://i.imgur.com/Rbwz6nm.jpg) in [***quick***.](https://i.imgur.com/x4fE9hM.jpg)


Alright guys, I think at this point I can definitely say that shit has without a doubt just gotten real.  That was just sleet that I ran into, the real prize was right [after that](https://i.imgur.com/LXLBoqV.jpg).  I thought it was cool and all until it turned into an actual [blizzard within minutes.](https://i.imgur.com/oIyoSfl.jpg)

The guy in front of me knew where the road was so I followed his old tracks, easy peasy.  Snow fall picked up super quick and covered almost all the tracks.  I'm going off of Google Map's lines to keep me straight.  Thankfully another person came up behind me and immediately recognized me as "that guy from Texas" and let me follow his tracks.

Just barely made it to the hotel and against my best efforts, slid right through a stop sign.  Luckily this place is deserted and I knew to tap my breaks so I didn't get close to hitting anything, but I damaged my pride.  I can now admit that I might be in over my head.

It's been 15 minutes, and we're at  [a couple inches.](https://i.imgur.com/hzzkhbI.jpg)  i'll be lucky to get out of here Tuesday, but on the plus side, this is a comfortable cold and I like walking so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯



_________
If anyone's interested, I just made an account on Snapchat and Insta ; lateforth3party   seems easier than posting everything on hereWe were talking about careers, and I told him that I'm not too sure about what I want to do, although I do know that I want to do something that makes the world a better place in some way. My dad, ever thoughtful, paused and responded: "I don't think you should worry about that too much. You already make the world a better place just by being you." 

I love my dad.Unfortunately, where I live there’s lots of anti maskers. The CDC said if you’re fully vaccinated it’s fine to not wear a mask, but I don’t want to make essential workers uncomfortable

Edit: why are comments disabled? 🤔This weekend it is my boyfriends birthday, so we booked a city weekend away. I was in charge of booking the hotel so I added my request and told my boyfriend I would tell him what is was after we got the hotel, assuming it would never happen

Today we got to our hotel room and put our bags down. 
The beside table we have it one of those that swivels so you can eat breakfast in bed. So i was bemused by that, before realising there is a print out of a llama saying be happy! 

I am so stoked.



EDIT; picture of the request and the llama!

Llama hotel https://imgur.com/gallery/j7jogUbWhen I was younger we had a family tradition when picking out our Christmas tree. My 2 brothers and I would play hide and seek in Home Depot while my dad picked out the tree. It was something I always looked forward to and was such a fun time.

I’m 25 now and have been picking out my own tree for a couple of years, but I only just now realized that it’s a much speedier process to pick out a tree than it was growing up.

I realized that my dad had been pretending for all those years that picking out a tree took way longer than it actually does just so my brothers and I would have time to play together. I asked him yesterday if that’s what he did, and he just smiled and laughed a little and said “oh yeah!”

I just think that was so sweet. I love my dadWhat's your personal "nothing" to do? Today my nothing is Reddit, Facebook, and Tubi. Busted my back working yesterday. Just need to veg today.You go to work, maybe you’re understaffed or you’re overwhelmed with clientele/customers. You bust your butt all day, maybe even skip a break or two just so you can get out of there faster, and when you get home...

You don’t want to do the dishes, you don’t want to do the laundry or even cook yourself food. Forget about showering tonight or grabbing groceries, you’re tired and you just want to sit down and relax. 

All these things pile up and it’s so overwhelming but you can’t do it right now, you have to go to bed so you can get up for work the next day. So you put it all off, say “I’ll do it on my days off”.
Then maybe you get called in, or maybe you’re so tired on that first glorious day of freedom that you just don’t have the energy to do even the things that you love. So you start to think you’re lazy.

My job recently underwent some major changes, I have new bosses and many new coworkers. 
We’re taking on the same amount of work or more, but I’m leaving work less exhausted than I used to. 

I’ve done my laundry after getting home from work twice now, which is something I don’t often do. I took a shower after working all day because I had more time to feed myself during the day and I wasn’t afraid of passing out while in the shower. 
I caught up on dishes on my weekend, and things are starting to feel a lot less overwhelming than they usually do.

We’re not lazy, we’re just tired. I’ve been thinking I was lazy and loosing my off-the-clock work ethic for the last half a year, turns out I was just being overworked.

EDIT:
Wow! Woke up and saw all the love and support I could ever need! Take a nap, have a cookie, you deserve it.

EDIT 2: I realize I’ve helped a lot of people today, maybe in a small way or maybe in a big way too, who knows. But I want you all to remember the moral of this post. Write it on a post-it note and slap in on your bathroom mirror, your front door. You’re all clearly doing a lot more than you think, and again thank you to every one of you.I know it's not literally everyone on reddit but almost every community I go to is full of either rude, harsh, condescending, overly sarcastic/sardonic, exceedingly crass etc comments even about the most innocuous of topics. I don't get it. And I don't think it's just internet anonymity, because having been to many other forums for many various things on the internet, (granted not as large as reddit) and none have this problem. People on other forums still speak as kindly and civilly as they would irl, and they're just as anonymous. It's something different with reddit.

It just feels refreshing to see people engaging kindly with each other here.i had around 20 for various people , everything was planned and i was ready this time 6 months ago . since then ive managed to recover more than i ever have before , and today decided to delete them for good . im feeling really good about my state of mind right now and am the happiest ive been in years , it’s good to be here

[obligatory edit .. my heart is full man , holy shit thanku so much for the support i am so overwhelmed .. this is absolutely mental]My mom never made me feel bad for not liking an ingredient or not finishing my plate. She always told me to listen to my body so it's okay if I'm full before the end of the meal. Whenever I show shame for wasting food she always says "it's okay, the dogs will love the treat!" and that mindset has made me a better adult. If I lose money or clothes or whatever I always think "Whoever found that must've really needed it!"



Which is a mindset I think parents try to teach with the whole "THERE ARE CHILDREN STARVING IN AFRICA" argument but it does the opposite, it makes kids obsessive over not wasting anything which can lead to some serious depression when we live in a world where 0 waste is absolutely impossible.



Thank you, mom, for teaching me the value of things, even if it wasn't in a traditional way.



Edit: I wish I could reply to all your comments but this has been so overwhelming and I am so thankful for all of your replies! You guys are the best 🖤 Thank you, reddit, for being such an amazing and loving community🖤This really made my day and it was so thoughtful that she said anything at all. To be honest, we literally were acting like children in a candy store, but this made me wonder: when do you guys allow your "inner child" to surface? I think it's important to remember that although we are adults there is still much in this world to discover and marvel. We can't lose our inner child.I don't know why I never expect people to do nice things for me. Even if it's my own boyfriend, it always catches me off-guard. I think I missed about 5 minutes of Chernobyl thinking about this incredibly small gesture. He pulled his own hand out from under the blanket to smooth things over so I could see better. Then he smiled, kissed my forehead and continued to watch like it's nothing.

We've been through a lot, me and him. Some days I still can't believe he's here, or that I'm here. It feels like being loved, though. Is that what love is? The small stuff? I could honestly cry over this small snippet of our lives right now.

I'm in the mood for sappy lovey-dovey moments so if anyone has some, I'd love to read them.

Also, apologies if this is the wrong sub. I couldn't think of a more appropriate one.

*Edit:* hey, to the person with ASPD - I saw your reply! Sorry about your experience :/ Also, guys, I read every comment that comes to my inbox! No one is late to the party :)

*Edit2:* to everyone who said I should show him this thread, I did! He's now very proud of himself and has claimed all the credit.

*Edit3:* y'all make me so happy. Hug your people tight and never take them for granted :) And to those who don't have your people yet, don't give up! Everyone deserves love.My mind is blown 
Edit: okay well apparently everyone else got it wrong too so

Ftfy We’re supposed to invite a few neighbors and friends over to eat BBQ tonight. This would be like 50 people including kids and babies AT MOST. Dad apparently spent $3800 on the extra smoker, pans, seasonings, and the ribs themselves. 

He’s like a puppy who peed on the carpet because he knows this was stupid but he’s in too deep now and has to finish cooking the ribs. It’s hilarious because he has this embarrassed little smile on his face and my mother is storming through the house going off on him in Spanish. 


There’s so many ribs I can’t stop laughing. Now he keeps saying he’ll load up the truck and give them to hungry homeless people but my mom knows he’s trying to get in her good graces so she said, “that wasn’t your original plan!” And stormed off again 😂😂

My dad has a history of doing this. He got into woodworking a few years ago and currently has like 20 or so projects at various stages of completion.

I went out to his shop one day a few months back and he was surrounded by sawdust and wood and half done projects. At first it was just quiet because I was surprised at the mess and then he said, “I may have gone overboard with woodworking.”

I love my dad he’s so lovably oafish with certain things. 


**EDIT: if anyone is somewhat near KC, MO and is seriously wanting some ribs, message me. Seriously. We need to get rid of this stuff because we’d need another freezer to store it all lol. This message is approved by my father.**So this happens to me quite often. I'll end up in this weird state for days where the day will mosey on by all the while I've wanted to do things like jump into a video game, work on hobbies, or pick up the house... Yet, I end up doing next to nothing more than staring at the front page of YouTube or reddit. In the end, 8 hours have passed and I just feel like going to bed. Sometimes this period lasts for days in a row.

What the heck is wrong with me? I feel like I'm wasting my life, and yet can't grasp any motivation.

Anyone else in this boat, or has been in the past?I'm usually the last one to get into bed at night (thanks, excessive skincare routine). Even though we live in a warm climate, my feet are always really cold when I slide under the covers, and on my own would take forever to warm up enough for me to fall asleep.

But now, every time I come to bed, rather than scoot away from them, my boyfriend raises his knees, and lowers his legs onto my feet so they get toasty warm so much faster! He started doing this unconsciously, I guess after he noticed that I try to move my feet close to him at night because his side of the bed is so warm. Just that little gesture makes me feel so cared for, I know having ice cold feet in your warm bed-cocoon isn't comfortable.

As for me, I have pretty long, natural nails. So when he turns over to fall asleep, I give his whole back a good scratch. It seems silly, but I try to get all the spots that he can't reach himself, and it really seems to relax him. Just my way of saying one more "I love you" before sleep, I guess.

Edit: What are some little rituals you have with people you care for? I love hearing about those details that make relationships uniqueSo, I ordered a pizza for my wife and myself.  Pretty standard fare.  Delivery guy shows up, it's the wrong order.

Pizza guy was a kid, maybe 20 years old, more likely 18 or 19.   He apologized and left with a glum look on his face.  About twenty minutes later he showed back up with my order and he just looked defeated.  Initially I had planned to give him a 20 and let him keep the change for the tip, but they discounted the order and it was just shy of 10 bucks.  There was a ten spot sitting on the hutch by the front door so I just handed him that and asked him to hang on a second because I knew I have fives in my wallet in the other room.  But I guess he just assumed he wasn't getting a tip when I walked away from the door with the pizza.

The kid walked back to his car while I wasn't looking, I guess he figured he was out of a tip.  I go back to the door and see the kid getting into his car on the street.  So I walk up the drive to the street and wave him back.

"Hey! You're tryin' to leave without your tip!" I yelled to him, but he couldn't really hear me from inside the car so he got out and met me at the top of the drive.  He asks, "Oh, was something else the matter?"

Instead of answering his question I asked him, "What's got you so glum, son?"  Keep in mind, I'm a big guy, with a beard, and a belly and I wear Bermuda shorts in the middle of Texas.  Think Urban Grizzly Adams but a little angrier looking.

The kid was obviously surprised by my question.  But he answered honestly and told me, "I'm from *a small town* East of *this major city* and it's my first month here and it's been a rough couple of weeks."  So, I asked him to go on.

He went on to tell me he missed his parents and his friends, but he was dedicated to his schooling and that it was necessary for him at the time being.  And I said to him, "That's it?" and just kinda left the question floating between us and that's when he says to me, "Well, my boyfriend also broke with me and it's been really tough."  Then he had this look of mortification on his face when he, I guess, realized he just outed himself to a stranger that he didn't know from Adam.

I looked at him and said, "Oh, man, that's rough.  Well, here, you were trying to leave without your tip."

As I was handing him the cash, I said, "C'mere man.", and opened my arms up for a hug.  This kid just threw his face into my chest and hugged me back so hard that I knew in that moment it was the right thing to do.

When the hug ended, not too long, not too short, I held onto his shoulders, looked him in the eyes and told him, "It's going to be okay.  You're young, and feelings can be overwhelming, but keep your chin up and your nose in the books.  Ten years from now you'll have forgotten about what-his-face and you'll be happier and more successful than you can imagine now, especially if you continue to be the honest person I think you are."  Or something like that.

All he said was, "Wow, thank you.", and I turned around and walked back down to my driveway.

[Today I found this on my door.](https://imgur.com/c4j8a)  I guess it meant more to him than I realized.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Has anyone else had any encounters like this?  I'd love to hear about it.

&#x200B;

Edit: Holy smokes, this thread blew up while I was sleeping!  I can't respond to everyone, but I am reading all the comments.  I'm glad my story touched so many of you.  Full disclosure, I'm by no means a perfect example of kindness, but I do my best.  My life has been plagued with violence and tragedy, but it's also had it's moments of pure love and joy.  It's those moments I live for.

I have learned, finally, to focus on the things in my life that helped me grow to be a better human being, it took me a long time. I'd like to think that's why this story happened, because I somehow grew into the man I hoped I would one day be.

I am real.  My life has been too real.

And this story is really real.  My wife and I were laughing about it last night before bed, I told her someone said I was trolling and she made some puns that were just... awful.  But I love her still.

Thank you all for your kind words and shared stories.  They all mean a lot to me, really.I'm possibly getting cats on Saturday and I'm so excited. I've graduated college, got a job and a place to live all in the past year. I'm finally at a place where I can afford to get a cat. I'm so excited. I've been waiting for years. 

I was throwing around adoption applications and someone responded. I wasn't expecting to be accepted so soon. Now I've got to buy all the cat stuff I've been eyeing all long. 

I'm just super excited. I've already told my family and casually dropped it into conversations at work. Now I've got to wait until Saturday before I can go meet them.


Edit:

What a bummer. One of them got sick so they're holding them for a little longer to give them medicine. I've waited this long, I can wait another week or so for them to get better. Healthy kitties are happy kittiesA couple of months ago I had a really bad time with my mental health, and I told my dad that I had just spent 4 days in bed. 
Since I told him he has called me daily for a chat. He makes sure I’m OK, and we don’t hang up the phone until we’ve told each other “I love you”

Edit- told my dad about this post, and the love he’s been getting. He says he loves you all and hopes you’re doing good.I'm a semi-large, bearded, heavily muscled 24 year old young-man that has taken up hobbies including wood working, metallurgy, rock climbing, and all kinds of music with a primary focus in guitar and piano. (I recently finished making a beautiful, seated drafting table out of walnut and ash ! )

Essentially this is all to say, I look and comport myself in many people's image of what being a man truly is. I'm very compassionate and polite, but not afraid to stand my ground and a very hard worker; so all-in-all I think I make a good name for myself.

So there I was on a date with this gal that I met climbing. We had hit it off, and she expressed an interest in me enough to give me her card and tell me to call her, which I did. I include this to show that clearly she wasn't *not interested* in me.

As we were talking, we found common interests in reddit, certain geeky hobbies like anime, casual drug use like smoking and drinking, and music -- when we got to this topic, clearly I made a (wonderful) mistake. I mentioned that when I was playing guitar a lot more often when I had the time, I would sometimes paint my nails to strengthen the nail-beds so I didn't have any tear or break while plucking over and over again. She hid her mild surprise, but I could tell something was off.

She then commented that men painting their nails is a massive turnoff to her, because "I prefer more manly men, know what I mean?"

I wanted to say 'No, I don't know what you mean. Would you care to explain?' but to be honest just wanted to avoid the confrontation.

After this major halt in the vibe, the date didn't last much longer.

Sorry for the long story, but I'm curious what y'all's thoughts are? Does me having painted nails occasionally make me less of a man? Is that any different from me telling her "well I prefer women who don't share their opinions and stick up for themselves -- you know, more 'girly-girls', know what I mean?"

I walked away feeling as though I had dodged a bullet!

Edit: Holy shit and a half, I hopped on a plane after answering every comment, landed and turned off airplane mode and was assaulted! Thank you all for the kind words of support. I’ve never meant it until now but rip my inbox. TIL there are a lot of cool very accepting people on reddit. Thanks y’all for making my day!So I misread my work schedule yesterday and showed up 15 minutes late. I realized this when I saw I got a call from work after I parked. When I double checked my schedule, I found I was late.

As I ran in, I was greeted with smiles and a couple of coworkers asking if I was okay. My manager seemed so happy to see me. When I told him why I was late, he was okay with it. He told me that everyone was concerned for me since I had never been late before.

This isn’t much, but it felt kinda good to know that they were actually concerned for me. Idk.

Edit: so uhhh yeah! I was not expecting over 2k upvotes! I’d like to thank everyone who read it; I’m glad you all enjoyed it. :)

Edit 2: oh my god, 12.8k upvotes! That’s insane!! Like, I just want to thank you all. This really was just a positive little anecdote and I was never expecting it to grow like this. I’m still glad you all enjoyed it. :)Personally, I've been a captions on person for as long as I can remember and I have always felt alone on this one. Nobody in my life appreciates the power of captions. I tend to not be able to hear what is being said in TV shows and movies when the characters are talking extra quiet or even whispering (I'm not hard of hearing either, I just want to absorb all the dialog). Also, I'm so used to having captions on that I just naturally watch TV at a lower volume. I know that sounds weird, but it's the norm for me. It's just so funny becuase everyone else in my life HATES when I put on captions. They say it's distracting to their viewing experience. They can't tolerate having captions on, and I cannot enjoy TV when they are turned off. 

Which side are you on?

*Edit: Wow who would've known my late night thoughts about captions would be so popular! Our grandchildren will be speaking of the greatest captions debate known to man happened right here on Reddit. I love seeing all the anti-captioners arguments in here, there are some pretty valid points! I love a good debate. But in my humble opinion, if you want the best TV watching experience, captions are the way to go.*

*Edit #2: Quick random thought, it's near impossible to watch TV without captions while eating chips. I cannot hear anything that is being said over the loud noise of chip crunching. Captions are king!*

*...also let me take this chance to say that you are perfect just the way you are. Cut out all the negative people around you, and just keep on doing what makes you happy* ✌I’m not much of a poster on Facebook, but I find myself getting in imaginary arguments with some of the morons from my home town with their bigoted views regularly, I found the power it had to put me in a bad mood unnerving to say the least.

To add to that, my lack of posting on recent events upset someone I know well that is a hard left vocal poster. He told me that my lack of voice on social media made me a hypocrite and part of the problem. I have been giving 10% of my wage and 20% of my bonus to relevant organisations for over 2 years now, ever since my black friend Charles, was racially abused at his place of work. I’m not saint, and sure, there probably is more all of us can be doing, but like f*ck am I going to let someone judge me for not sharing posts online.

Anyway, that was my final straw, I’m going to continue doing my part financially, and continue doing so with pride, but I’m no longer letting myself get sucked into the vortex of Facebook and their bad ethics and grossly addictive platform.

And yes, I know, I should delete other apps created by them, but I’m not going to. Facebook is the mental mind fuck that has been most damaging, and with no remorse and a genuine sigh of relief I’m glad to say bye to it.

Edit: everyone here is very kind, understanding, and thoughtful. Interesting to see such a huge acknowledgment of how toxic Facebook is. If you’re tempted, try temp deleting and getting rid of the app. It helps. Have a great weekend everyoneI’ve been building for the last few months because I enlisted in the military.  I’ve made quite a bit of progress and have gained a good amount of muscle (I can do 10 pull ups). I think building muscle feels empowering as fuck. Like I want to keep pushing myself further and further and my whole day revolves around my workouts and diet. I love seeing my progress in the mirror and the rising stats. I want to keep getting stronger and tougher. I want to lift heavier shit all the time. Feel great to be fit and strong!I know this may seem a bit insignificant to most, but my mother and I have been trapped in a house with someone quite awful for the last 8 years of our lives.

Over the past month we have collected enough money to rent an apartment.

We are trying our best to find furniture and stuff, but honestly... I’m super happy.

I’m so excited to finally get out of this shithole!

Love all of you guys, had to say this to someone.

Edit: Wow! Did not expect this much support! Thank you for the award guys and thanks for all this helpful information!! I’m so thankful

Edit: HOLY COW! 4k upvotes?? Thank you guys for the support and all the love. I honestly cried for a few minutes there from all the sheer love.

Edit: this is unbelievable. Thank you everyone. Thank you to those who donated, my mother and I are eternally grateful.I basically have nothing to do for three weeks due to this quarantine. I always have a bad habit of going to bed late, but recently I can barely even fall asleep at 5 AM. I think my body just isn’t using enough energy during the day.Currently laying in bed in my little sisters room, trying to make myself tired enough to fall asleep. I get married tomorrow to my best friend and the love of my life. COVID & a rainy forecast have drastically changed our plans, but I’m still ecstatic to marry him. 

I haven’t lived with my parents for nearly two years but decided to sleep here for a “last hurrah.” It was bittersweet to sit on the couch before bed and laugh at stupid videos with them one last time. 

Today was one of those days where life seems to slow down & you can fully appreciate all that’s brought you to where you are, and anticipate what’s to come. 

There’s not much point to this, really. I’m just grateful.

EDIT: yes I know I’m not single. I figured that’d be the best word to keep the title short, and I’ll no longer check “single” on forms - I love him so much that having our relationship officially recognized means a lot to me. Also, my relationship with my family is NOT changing, but this particular chapter of life is. That’s what I meant to convey!A man collapsed on the train I was travelling to school on this morning. When it happened he was about 10ft away from me. He just slumped onto the floor, and everyone else on the train just stood and looked but took no action. I remembered what I'd read about the bystander effect on Reddit and decided I needed to be the person to act, so I told a woman to call an ambulance and went over to the man on the floor.

He was wearing 5-6 coats (so I am assuming he was homeless) so I ripped them off and tried to find a pulse. After about 30 seconds another woman came over who said she was a nurse and she began talking to the paramedic on the phone while I tried to get a pulse. Couldn't find one so I began chest compressions and not long after the man started to groan and it seemed like he was breathing again. After it was confirmed he was breathing (but was still unconscious) the nurse and I put him in the recovery position and I waited with him till the ambulance came.

I'm only 17 so this was a pretty crazy experience for me. The adrenaline in my body afterwards was so strong I felt like I was on drugs. Sorry if this post was long or formatted badly (I'm on mobile) but I just thought it would be good to write about my experience.I wanted to check my emails before I fall asleep and there was the big "your application status has changed". Guess there's no sleep for me now

Edit: Thank you all for congratulating me. I'll try to answer you all tomorrow, I really need some sleep now :)

Edit number two: Again, thanks for all the feedback! I fell asleep quicker than I thought last night and I'll try to answer as many comments as I can throughout the day. I'm just updating the post to tell y'all that it's morning where I am right now, and I of course already called my parents (I would call my best friend as well, but she sleeps until noon and has her phone on mute)Obviously this specific memory is just an example but I feel like smells are very particular and can trigger a memory more vividly than any other sense. Also, everytime a new season begins and the smell of the air changes I become very nostalgic and have a rush of memories from that season from various different years.I was in a bad funk last year. Before going see my grandparents, my mom asked me to brush my hair. I remember sobbing because the idea of detangling my hair was so overwhelming. I ended up sitting in my underwear while my mom rinsed my hair in the sink. I was so embarrassed. 
This year, I woke up early, downed two cups of coffee, and knocked on her door with a gift for her. 
Obviously not all of 2020 has been this good, and the majority of this year pistol whipped me. However, seeing how far I’ve come has been a dope ass christmas gift :)
EDIT: did NOT realize this post blew up!! Thank you all for being so kind and sharing your stories. I want to try and reply to as many people as I can without blowing up my own thread. I appreciate y’all.Pretty mundane, right? Well, my dear boy (9) is autistic and while he is high functioning in his day to day life, unfamiliar enviroments can send him into a tailspin. Today was not that day! He got his teeth cleaned, got xrays, went into the 360° xray thing, and had the dentist poke around in his mouth with absolutely 0 problems, Also NO cavities!

Then I asked if he was okay with getting a hair cut and he gave me an enthusiastic "Yep!" I was worried that we were over doing it a tad but he sat through like a champ! The hair dresser even complemented him on his behavior.

After we were done with everything we went and got lunch and I told him how proud I was and he said "Sometimes you just have to power through the stuff you don't like." He looked empowered and confident.

Today was a good day. No tears. No fear. Just powering through the stuff. I'm so stinkin proud of my boy!Not sure where she came from but she knocked on my door a few minutes ago.I usually dont entertain strangers but I opened the window and listened to her please. She was breathing heavy and was asking for $20 for her  breathing medication. She had an empty package in her hand for an small asthma inhaler and pleaded with me because she was having trouble breathing.

To me this screamed scam all over it but I felt bad and gave it too her anyways(I have asthma so im symapthetic and I also marked the $20 with a black marker). From my house I waited until she was out of sight so I can follow her. She walked a very long distance and eventually made it to a pharmacy.

I snuck and followed her inside and to my surprise she actually got medicine from the pharmacy using the $20 i gave her. 

This restored my faith in people a bit. 🙂Anyone on Facebook knows that, beginning around a week before your birthday, you get nagged to create a fundraiser. And that's cool I guess. So a little while ago, I chose to create one, mostly to stop the reminders.

I picked the National Suicide Prevention hotline as "my" charity. My little sister committed suicide in 1998, and yeah, it's an important cause. For more than 2 decades, my/our mom has made every excuse in the world to deny that her daughter committed suicide. (From "she was murdered," to "she didn't know what she was doing." And everything in between.)

Today, five minutes after I clicked a couple of things to create my fundraiser? My mom donated to the hotline. She's growing, and I am so proud of her, you know?I'm 37 and single. I don't have any kids. My sister has a husband and 4 beautiful children. I've always thought it was my responsibility to be there for her, to help wherever I could. "It takes a village" is more than just a motto to me. I help watch the kids, be there financially or emotionally, or whatever is needed. That's just what family does. The kids come spend time at Aunt Lisa's house, hang out, play games, whatever. A few times a week I come over for dinner. I'm at all the soccer games, concerts, fund raisers, or school fairs. They're just part of my life. My sister tells me regularly that she couldn't do it without me. She's super grateful. But still, inside, I've never felt like I was on the same level as her. Like I didn't live up to what I could have been - a wife and mom - so this is the consolation prize. This is my second best place I could help the world. Until last night.

We were talking about Thanksgiving, having it at her place (obviously, since she has so many more people and more room). She said it was weird to think that in 20 years she would have grandkids. If each of the kids were married and had just 2 kids each, that would be another 12 people. She's just always made the assumption that would happen. But then for the first time ever she said - "but that's if they all choose to get married. If not, that's fine. If one of them doesn't, the others would have their own Aunt Lisa, and that's awesome."

Hearing that she thought that was ok for her kids made it all different. Being single and a helper wasn't just a second place fill-in, but an appreciated, important status. It made me feel valued, and I knew that my nieces and nephews would feel valued, no matter what their future holds.

Edit: Thank you all for your support, and for sharing your own stories below. It's amazing to hear how similar we are. Bloom where you are planted! I hope you all have a great day, and please keep commenting. :)I had 2 beers, 3 glasses of wine and now my 3rd Gin and Tonic and I'm all warm and feelgoody inside and my wife has her curls loose and is laughing and the kids are asleep. My government is falling apart over slaughtering mini (denmark) and 2 of the guys I work with got the covid but it doesn't fucking matter because I'm so happy and content.
Have you guys seen hamilton? That shit slaps we just watched it 2 nights in a row and we washed the floors with the music on today 10/10.
Is it even allowed to drunk post on this sub? Who cares no one will see this.
Have a good weekend boys and girls. Trans rights are human rights and people with psychiatric illness are valid and matter and deserve compassion and respect.

PEACE OUT

EDIT: My 3 kids woke me up after 4 hours of sleep and I might still be a little drunk. My wife is sleeping we're watching Frozen 2. Life is good thank god for netflix and cereal. Much love to you all and your kind words, may your lives be fulfilling and you be content. See you in a year when I get to drink again!Earlier I was thinking about my next birthday and how time is going by so fast.. I feel like I will be 80 soon enough (despite only being 18). I had a little panic and thought to myself

 "no! I don't want to die!" 

and then I paused and smiled to myself because thats the first time I have thought that in years.Ever since my family got an internet connection 10 years and 4 months ago, wikipedia has saved my ass countless times. I never really thought about donating, mostly because I was from a poor(er) country, and I understood well when my parents told me that planning every coin matters. One year ago, when I started university I realized that soon I would be able to earn my own money. That's when I promised myself to repay those who have helped me in life. For the last three weeks I was able to find a holiday job in the UK, and I earned my first real spending money. And today I honored my promise, I donated what I could afford to Wikipedia.

Thank you Wikipedia. Keep doing what you're doing!I was driving home and saw a truck driving behind two young girls who were riding their bikes. I live close to a school so it's common to see kids walking or riding bikes around this time. The truck was driving slow enough to stay just barely behind them as they rode their bikes. It would slow down and move to the side when cars came up from behind rather than speeding up. I noticed this as I was driving towards them on a long straight road and started an internal debate around what it was that was happening.  Was this guy following them a friend/family or was this someone following them as a predator. I kept making excuses for the person in the truck to make sense of it but I just couldn't help the feeling that something could be wrong.  As I was passing the truck I realized they had out of state plates which was the final warning sign for me. I was too conflicted and concerned to just let it go. I thought to myself I'd be devastated if something bad happened and I didn't intervine.

I flipped the car around and pulled up beside the guy so that we could address my concerns. I asked if he knew the girls and he was a little shocked that I would ask him this. Then he realized the way it must have looked. He explained that he had taken his daughters bikes to the school so that they could ride their bikes home and he could follow safely behind. The girls stopped too and there was some confirmation that he was their dad.

I left feeling a little like an A-hole but in the end I hope that if it was my daughter out there and someone was following her, he or anyone else would do the same. I hope he understands. 

TL/DR: saw guy in a truck following behind 2 girls. After some internal debating and a few too many warning signs I stopped the guy. He was their father just following them to make sure they were safe on their bike ride home from school.So, I have this coworker who’s in her early 60’s. The woman is a total enigma. She’s an incredible teacher, and I doubt she’s met anyone she can’t teach. Let’s call her Michelle. I went to Michelle today because I, a millennial, am struggling to train a new baby boomer on our unit. Of course, Michelle asked me to explain why I felt I was struggling to get through to the new baby boomer and what I thought she could do better than I could. I said, “I don’t know Michelle, he’s just asking for the “why” behind a ton of things on the computer and I genuinely do not have an answer for most of it. I feel like you are able to come up with an answer to anything asked of you. I also feel like I’m having trouble trying to get him to organize his flow.” 

Michelle says something along the lines of, “it sounds like he probably needs a fellow boomer to train him. I’ve trained a lot of you millennials now, and I can tell you, you guys think way differently than us. *When I watch you millennials on the computer it’s almost like you guys learn by forming patterns on the screen and with your clicks.* Computers are so intuitive to you. You don’t even have to think about it, *you just do it by thinking in the patterns you’ve formed.* When us boomers get on the computer we want to know why we are clicking things and what it will lead to, it isn’t automatic for us.” 

My fellow millennials agreed that we definitely learn things on the computer by forming patterns, and teach by trying to show others the pattern. But none of us had ever thought about it that way. Consider me shooketh.

Edit: Please do not think I feel that baby boomers are lowly and “useless” in today’s world as someone has implied in the comments below. The term “boomer” is not meant to be derogatory, just as the term “millennial” should not be derogatory either. My coworkers and I are comfortable with each other and hash out baby boomer/millennial banter all the time. We also have very meaningful conversations about our differences, and get along great.

Edit: apparently the term “boomer” is not okay, but “baby boomer” is, so for the sake of not offending anyone further, I will change my terms in this text post to “baby boomer.” But you guys should know that my coworkers shout “boomer down!” and “boomer in distress!” when they need me to handle a technology problem at work. I’ve genuinely never thought of it as a derogatory term, and I don’t think any of them do either.So as you all know, we are reaching the point where wearing a mask everywhere is no longer required. While most people are happy to hear the news, I have to admit I'm not that ecstatic regarding the situation. As simply as I can put this I like my mask now. It's my safezone. I feel comfortable with it on. Not to mention the fact I have a big nose so covering  up the most insecure part of my body has been an enormous relief. I will certainly be the last to unmask although I feel like a clown especially when I wear the damn thing outside as well. I can just hear people perplexed as to why that idiot is still wearing a mask by himself outside in the middle of these triple digit temperatures. Lord, spare me the anguish please.Context. My partner said to me "can you do the dishes while I bath baby?" and I said, "no, you can do both" as a joke. 

Nothing much of a conversation, but my daughter said "haha mum, you got roasted".

I explained to her that roast was not a word I thought she knew, and that my understanding of roast was to make fun of someone, with their permission, and not meaning it. 

Obviously she has picked up stuff from Youtube, because her return was "i cant roast you because I was told never to burn trash".

I was speechless.He's 16 and It was very emotional and I'm very proud of him. I'm confused though, it's as if I haven't seen him cuddling and kissing his boyfriend months before lockdown and for weeks now after.... I just assumed he was already out 🤷‍♀️, but I appreciate the 'formal' sit down and coming out as wellI work in a restaurant at the bar area, we can easily get 100+ reservations so it was a busy day. While I’m making some cocktails I notice this dude by himself looking rly uncomfortable, so after I finish I start to talk to him. He explained to me that he wanted to meet new people and that he is sick of being alone, I was rly impressed coz people like that usually accept it and find ways to enjoy being alone. We continue talking and I introduce him to some of my dailies that I know are rly chill. I have to go back to work so i dont talk to him for a couple of hours but when I look back he is sitting with 5 other people laughing, he looked like he was having the time of his life.
Good on you bro, keep at it!

If you ever feel this way, try doing the same thing he did. It will be a bit uncomfortable at first but when u meet a few people you will relax yourself.I live in Colorado, and we're having some crappy weather at the moment. It snowed all of last night and still hasn't let up, and it's been about 15˚ F all morning.

I'm in high school, and I was pretty pissed we didn't have a snow day considering the weather. I was just thinking about what I had to do today, and I wasn't expecting to have anything like this happen to me.

As I was driving along, I noticed an SUV with its hazards blinking spun out in the dip on the side of the road. The windshield was mostly frozen over, and a stop sign was crushed beneath it. I didn't see anyone in the car, so I kept driving.

About a block later, I saw a small figure huddled up on a bench under a tree. They had their head in their hands and were rocking back and forth. They were only wearing jeans and a sweatshirt. I pulled over, rolled down my window, and asked them if they needed any help. A young woman looked up at me, and she'd clearly been crying. She told me it was her car that had broken down back there and that her phone was dead. She told me where she needed to go, and it was only about two miles back.

I let her in, and she immediately burst into tears. She told me she'd been out there for over an hour, and the few cars she'd seen hadn't stopped. She was shaking really badly and told me she'd been praying because she thought she was gonna die. She was here from out of state visiting a friend and didn't have any cash on her and she was really far from her hotel.

I let her use my phone to call her friend, and dropped her off at a 7/11 she'd been to before so she'd have somewhere warm to stay while she waited. Her friend picked her up at the gas station, and they both thanked me profusely.

I started driving back to school, and I just started crying because of how long she'd been out there, and how no one had picked her up.

I feel really good about myself right now, even though I think it was just an act of human decency. I hope someone would do the same for me.

Edit: Thank you for all the wonderful comments, and of course, the gold and silver! I think the world presents a chance to do something good to everyone, and today I took mine.

Edit #2: Just to clear up a common point of confusion, she didn't know which direction the gas station was, or how far away it was. She was lost in a foreign state while it was snowing pretty hard, so I understand why she stayed by the crash.I had a pretty rough day yesterday suffering the side effects of a certain jab. I had a fever, chills, aches, the lot. I stayed under the covers for most of the day, drifting in and out of consciousness.

My boyfriend sat next to me and read to me every time I was awake. There wasn't much else we could do together, so he made sure I was hydrated and warm, and spent hours upon hours just reading to me. When I fell asleep half-way through, and he had to re-read some paragraphs, he didn't get mad, and he did it on his own. At some point he thought I was asleep and he tucked me in and whispered to himself "Man I love this woman" as he left the room to get some water.

I have never before felt so at peace with anyone else.

I will marry him one day.

Just wanted to put this out there in the universe.When I got to the window, the guy handed me my two frosty's. Shut the window. Opened the window again, holding two frosty's. "I already gave you your frosty's, didn't I?." "Yup" 

He sighed while looking at the frosty's, and handed them out as well. "enjoy" and oh boy will I enjoy. 

What's the best thing that's happened to you this week?Fast forward, 6 years later I got my first job and after getting my first salary, I ordered food she liked to eat! She was taken aback and asked me if it may cost a lot, but I told her that I've always wanted to do this for her! It isn't much,but I'm happy that I could finally treat her with that food!


Sorry if my English was bad,English isn't my first language!I’m from a third-world developing country and a 5-figure dollar salary is upper-middle class range already.

Those people would be living in high-rise skyscraper condo units probably with a smart home system and a Dyson vacuum or in a mansion with like 5 to 6 bedrooms and a few maids and a driver.

I know that the cost of living is different, but that just makes it all the more startlingly different. I’ve heard that in the US, a small apartment in the major cities is like $3000 a month. Even for me now living in Japan, that’s a whole month salary for a full time job actually.

I can’t imagine a 6-figure salary. Especially if a married couple both earns like that. They’d be millionaires in a few months!

(Edit: I’m from the Philippines, but I now live in Japan.)Nothing is wrong with my life really, I am just longing for something different. I’m 24, have a house, a respectable job, good significant other, and I want to drop it all and run away and completely reinvent myself.

I don’t really know what the point of this post is I guess. Tell me some happy stories. Has anyone ever dropped everything to start new?

Edit: This got way more attention than I was expecting. This was just an in my feels post I made before work today, and while I can’t respond to everyone, I super appreciate all the comments.I used to be so scared of aging. Had some sort of mild existential crisis because I was growing old, my skin was getting older, my eyes weren't as youthful and full of energy as they used to be.

But I actually am really starting to feel alive only now that I am 25. I think it's around this time that you stop spending every minute obsessing what people think, how you are seen, how you look, what you do. And actually start making choices because you want to.

You decide who you really want to spend time with, how you want to pass your weekend, what music to listen to, how to dress, what hobbies to choose. It's the time where the peer pressure starts wearing off and you realize all the worries about how you are perceived are in your head.

I spend so many years worrying and agonizing over how I was perceived. Only now I am starting to enjoy my time and stopped being afraid of both time passing and how I decide to spend that time. I have accepted that I don't look super young anymore and that's okay. And that I might not be as full of energy as I was, but that's also okay.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I know, I know people who edit are losers. Just wanted to say, it's so cool to hear all of your experiences and different paths and hear from so many people that their life got steadily better as the decades pass :)my sister and her boyfriend were in the backseat, my mom was driving, and I was in the passenger seat. I'm on aux and "Don't Stop Me Now" by Queen came on. My sister and her boyfriend are doing the thing where, while singing along to a song, you look someone in the eye and pretend like you're saying the words of the song to that person. It's relevant to mention here that one line of the chorus is, "if you wanna have a good time, just give me a call". 

We get through the first chorus, and as the second verse starts, my sister says to me, "turn it down, someone's calling me." I do, and I turn around to see that both of them are on the phone. 

Her boyfriend says into the phone, "Hello, I would like to have a good time."

my sister says, "(boyfriend), why are you calling me?"

"you said to if I want to have a good time!"

My sister bursts out laughing- he had literally called her on the phone to make a joke about that one line. Those two get along so well, and I'm so glad they're happy together. I hadn't thought my sister could get any weirder, but they've been together for two years and she's sillier than ever. I'm so grateful she's in such a great relationship!

This is sort of a "you had to be there" story, but I still think it's really funny and I thought someone else might get a kick out of it.

edit to add: apparently the title's misleading, sorry about that!It was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. I fell in with the wrong people and almost lost my life over it. All it took was using one time and I had to have it as much as possible. I spent my entire paychecks on it until I inevitably quit my job because it was too much to focus on working when all I wanted to do was go get high. I sold most of my belongings just to support my habit. I began stealing things and panhandling for more. I lost my car, and my place of living. I lost all of my friends and respect from my family. I eventually found myself staying in an abandoned house south of Chicago with 3 other addicts. Almost got kidnapped, and overdosed once. I finally had enough and moved in with family over 2 hours away and never looked back. Here I am 7 years later with no relapse in sight. For those of you out there struggling with addiction, it is possible to put it down and walk away. It's not easy, not at all, but it can definitely happen. With the right support, the will to change, and the dedication to stay with it, anything is possible.



[Edit]

Just went on break at work and saw how much traction this has gotten and I have to admit it almost brings me to tears. Thank you everyone for the support and the unbelievably kind words. Also, thank you kind strangers for my first golds and silvers! This means more to me than any of you could ever know! You just made today that much better!

[Edit 2]

Holy cow this post just keeps going! Thank you to everyone for the endless support and sharing your own stories with me, it's been an amazing experience. Thank you so much as well to the kind stranger who awarded me my first platinum! There has been so many sad stories out there of loved ones lost and my heart goes out to you. The same for those who have loved ones who are struggling right now and those that are struggling themselves. On the flip side, many have shared  their own sobriety which warms my heart. Too often we hear of the other outcome and it's always refrshing to hear of others making it out in one piece. I want to thank each one of you for taking time out of your day to celebrate with me, share with me, or ask for my advise. I'm definitely no expert when it comes to advice but I try my best. I hope that each one of you out there that isn't struggling with addiction never does, each person out there that is struggling with addiction finds sobriety, and each person who has found sobriety clings to it for dear life.Don't really have anyone else to share this with as I have 0 friends and don't talk to family. But my god I think the medications I'm taking are working. I've been sitting alone in the dark in my room listening to music for the last 2 hrs.  
I didn't know music could sound this good. I haven't listened to music in years because of how bland it sounded. It feels like everything has been given a new life around me lol.   
before I spent my time doing absolutely nothing cause I didn't enjoy anything. It feels surreal to get some feeling back again.   
Thanks for reading   
EDIT: Okay wow this kinda blew up. I went to sleep and woke up to this. Thank you everyone for the kind words I really appreciate it!   
EDIT2: I have had a lot of people asking what meds I am taking. I am taking both Escitalopram(20mg) and Mirtazapine(15mg)I find it odd when people are afraid of spiders. When I was a child, a spider would make a web in my room every once in a while. My parents would make sure the room was clean, but they kept the webs and told me the spiders would keep me safe. I never developed a fear of them. In fact, I love them. I suppose a big venomous one would scare me, but a little spider makes me feel at home.Some might think that this titlte is stupid, or even wonder what the big deal is. But, i am a 25 year old man that weighs 115kg(253lbs), that have had a pretty sedentary life for the last 3 years.

Besides work, all i did was just sit in from of my computer, gaming. Muscles were, and still are, tight and stiff, my mobility is absolute garbage, pain in my lower back and hip was getting worse.

So, with all of this in mind, i decided that it was time for me to change something. To, finally, take care of myself. Otherwise, who will?Got a gym membership last week, and told the guy(PT) that my main goal is to lose weight, even more than that, i want to get a have good mobility. So, stretching is a big focus. And oh man, the pain is insane with some stretches.

Today was my third time going to the gym, and decided that i was going to run for as long as my body and mind would allow me too. With Amon Amarth blasting in my earphones, i managed. I managed to run for 10minutes straight, and the pain was killing me. My leg was numb, my lungs wanted to leave my body.

But, i fucking did it. And it feels good!  
Edit: Real thanks to all of you, from my heart! With all of your replies, sharing your stories, your suggestions, your kind words, i have felt a warmth in my heart that i hadn't felt in a really long time.So I'm a bus driver and this kid and his mom come on the bus. The kid sees that I have a couple face piercings (Snake Bites/Septum).
He tells me, "I think your piercings are so cool! Much cooler than the ones my mom has on her boobies."

OMG THIS FREAKING KID! haha

The mom almost went pale from embarrassment then just said quietly "Oh dear God"I'm 16, male. My friend and I were at the mall together and she held out her hand and said, "Could you hold this?"  Confused, I took her hand, and BOOM, we were holding hands.  I was so surprised and so happy at the same time! I like her a lot.  :)

Then I realized that I was holding her hand backwards, so I switched hands. Oops. I've never had been in a relationship or anything, so this is just so new and exciting for me.  :)

E:  Awww, my first gold ever! Thank you so much <3Why does everything have to be *either* loaded with sugar *or* sugar-free? Artificial sweeteners suck, and even natural sweeteners like stevia make things taste off (especially beverages imo). Can't we just have *some* sugar in moderation? A little more subtlety in commercial food would be appreciated.

Shout-out to Chobani for making those "less sugar" yogurt flavors. I need more of that. Are there other things like this on the market? (I'm in USA)My whole life I’ve taken baths mainly because they were peaceful and relaxing but also because I’ve always hated taking showers. I felt like the water stung  and standing was just inferior to laying back and chilling after a long day. I never kept this a secret and adamantly defended my bath taking position to friends and family. But it wasn’t until this weekend I was staying at a hotel for quarantine (it’s required for my university) and they didn’t have a bath so I had to take a shower and I realized for 19 years my water pressure had just been way too high! My whole life getting in the shower felt like I was storming the beaches of Normandy and getting fired at with rubber bullets made of water but this felt like an angel was crying on me in the best way possible! I’ve finally realized what everyone was telling me about showers being better and have even swapped sides!Not sure if this happens to other offices, but man we get at least 20 calls a day from random sketchy companies. They want to send us insurance quotes, even though we are very happy with our current insurance. They want to talk to the office manager about printing solutions. They want to see if they can place us on their "list" for "qualified contractors". 

When one of my former coworkers left, we never took her phone and extension off. At some point, I just started to transfer all these weird sketchy calls to "Tabby". 

Want to talk to the person in charge of our insurance? Let me transfer you to Tabby.

Want to send us a quote on window treatment? Talk to Tabby. 

Want to ask us sketch questions about our business even though I never heard of you and I'm 99.9% sure that you're calling me from a call center with a bunch of people in the background? Tabby is your girl. 

My Co-workers caught on, and now Tabby wears many many hats, and we definitely do not pay her enough. But she takes many many vacations and is never at her desk. She's a busy girl you know? But to our office, she is indispensable.It was pretty fast actually. I met her and we fell in love for each other instantly. I proposed 3 times and she said 'no' to 2 of them. The third time, i prepared a romantic lunch. When we finished, we played some videogames together and I proposed. I was soooo happy she said 'yes'. Now, my sim is married and i can continue playing this videogame with the achievement i received for getting married


Edit: forgot to say that as soon as i got married, i moved out. The first thing my wife did when we arrived at our new house was kiss the owner of the place (now my roommate) and he fuckingly accepted (they didn't even know each other)

Edit 2: guys wtf i was new with 20 karma and now i have almost 4000 lol thank you all for your support, being cheated on is hard and this may help me forget about it

Edit 3: hell wtf this went really fast, thanks guys for all those upvotes and the 2 silver awards. I guess that if i don't get gold now, never will i lol. Again thank you, that bitch may have cheated and is so useless she can't get promoted but I'll burn her maybe or something. Hopefully, never might i find someone like her againI’m a single dad, it’s just me and my 3yo son, every night I put him in his bed at bedtime but without fail, by morning, he’s climbed into my bed and I wake up with him cuddled up to me. 

Over the weekend though, he slept the whole night every night in his bed and only came into my room in the morning to wake me up. On one hand I’m proud of him for sleeping in his own bed and growing up, on the other hand I’m kinda sad that maybe a part of his childhood is over now and he doesn’t need me so much. Strange mixed emotions about it.Long story short, my brain just doesn't produce the chemicals needed for, well, emotions. Happiness, stress, anger, sadness? I get a small hint of them, but then its just gone. I've been unable to develop meaningful relationships with peers, and I just don't simply feel attached to or love my family like you feel. But there was this girl in freshman year of high school that, despite my inability to show real, genuine affection, loved me unconditionally. The love I feel for her may not be what she planned for, it may not be the fantastic romantic experience we all expect, but I do my best to show what I can. It's just hard for me is all.

But today, 6 years after I met that girl? My daughter, Elyza, was born into this world. I feel a burning sensation in my chest, I'm smiling, and I'm so fucking excited I'm making a post about it. I feel happy. Real, genuine happiness. I've had this feeling before, but either dulled or had the quick replacement of nothing shortly after. But I'm STILL happy, hours later.

The worlds looking a little bit brighter today. And I'm glad I can say that without pretending.This has been the single most challenging accomplishment of my life so far.  I have been taking online classes while working 50-60 hrs a week and raising a 9 and a 2 year old.  I used many lunch hours to work on homework, and there have been many late nights and it has all finally paid off!!!

Edit:  thank you all for the congratulations and the awards!  I just woke up and this had blown up, and I got my first gold!!!  You all rock and make me happy!I swear this is something straight out of a movie scene. It definitely made my night.

Basically what happened was I worked 10 hours today and haven't eaten anything all day long. I had such a massive appetite when I got off work I figured I'd treat myself and get 2 pizza's from my favorite place. I decided to order in person since the place is right down the street from my work. These aren't just some rinky-dink pizza's either, they are huge and have a bunch of toppings. 

I order the pizza's and the cashier says "Imagine if those were both for you" and starts laughing. I just burst out laughing and told him that as a matter of fact they are both for me. He looked so embarrassed and apologized. I told him I thought it was hilarious and thanked him for a good laugh. Then I went on my merry way and devoured both pizza's like a boss.

*Edit: Thank you kind friends for all the nice awards!! I didn't think this post would blow up like this! It's fun conversating with alot of you in the comments and hearing your stories!*

*To answer a few questions: 1) No, I'm not an absolute unit lol. Believe it or not, I'm only 140 pounds. I can just garner up an insane appetite if I go all day without eating combined with all full 10 hour labor work day. I've always been able to eat large portions. Like enough to serve 3 people lol. But I make up for it in being active and going long time frames inbetween meals every now and then.*

*2) Don't worry, I see the apostrophe issue in the word pizzas. My phone just autocorrected it to pizza's when typing it up. I'm not editing it out because it's already in the title!*

*3) Yes, I very much so enjoyed the pizzas.*I PAID OFF ALL MY LOANS!! I’m debt free!!!! I didn’t know who to tell and I didn’t want to post it on my social media because I don’t want to come off as bragging but I’m so happy! I paid off my car loan and my student loan! I’m only in my mid 20s so I feel really proud of myself. Anyways I hope everyone is having a wonderful day :)I just wanted to say I have been thinking about you guys a lot. I have little siblings who are seniors and man, it’s sucks. Everything y’all were looking forward to was canceled, prom, graduation, final concerts, games, performances, and everything. 


I know it doesn’t fix anything, but I am really sorry this happened. 


You are handling it with great maturity and dignity. (Much more than I would have, even) Thank you. I know you are sacrificing things you have been looking forward to for the good of our survival. Thank you. 


The world is a scary place. People give your generation a lot of crap, but the way I have seen you handle this gives me hope for the future.



Edit: 
WOW! This has blown up so much. There are so many of you if I don’t say it to you personally, I care for you and sincerely pray that things start to look up soon. I know everything is dark and confusing right now, but the sun will come up and we will be back together again. Heck, I’m a teacher and I am having a hard enough time navigating admin, what I feel is best for my students, and feeling isolated.


One commenter (I forgot who, sorry) said “maybe we are just making different memories” and that is a beautiful way to think about it. So let’s make some memories, learn new things so the world is a brighter place when we can gather together again

Edit #2: I would like to acknowledge all the other people who are graduating college and other things as well. I did not intend to dismiss you in this post. I was just talking to someone I care about who was in high school and that is what I was thinking about mainly at the time of writing this.


Edit #3: So many edits.

It was this super cute craft project she’d put together for her mom. 

I saw that she had a couple upvotes on the post and a couple comments but I know she’s extremely proud of  it so I wanted to make her feel super special about it. So I bought a bunch of reddit coins and gave her a platinum award anonymously. She’s not been feeling too great lately so I’m hoping this will give her a smile. I’m using a dummy account so she doesn’t somehow figure out it was me. 

I’m never going to tell her or anyone about it but it feels really good knowing that she probably is going to have a super happy moment when she checks reddit. And she’ll get to gift people awards I think? That’s the best. 

Anyways. I’m just feeling super good about it and I also wanted to hear about other people’s stuff they feel good about today? what’s going on out there in the reddit world?

Edit: I didn’t mean for this to get so big LOL oops but thanks so much for all the awards. I love Reddit. You people are awesome. 

Okay second edit: I just want to say holy crap, I have never had a Reddit post blow up this much. This is really cool. I’m pretty excited right now. I just wanted to clarify for a couple people I saw commenting.. I’m a girl, not some guy obsessed with a lady friend. Just a girl who really appreciates a close friend of hers and wanted to give her a happy moment. Anyways, thank you to all of you for this happy moment. This whole day I’ve been smiling because of you wonderful redditors. What a magical place this is.My daughter is in virtual school, and every window on her zoom screen is black save for the teacher.  I imagine he/she must feel like they're talking to themselves and it must be very hard. I hear stories of one student having the camera on and it makes me happy

Edit: thank you all for your comments, I had no idea it would blow up like this. Students, thank you for participating with video when allowed. Teachers, hang in there. Keep fighting the good fight. This won't last forever and soon you'll be able to see their disinterest in person!

Thanks also for the awards but they aren't necessary.So I have my alarm set for about 8 p.m. to remind me to take my medication daily. I don't usually take naps after work, but today I was really tired and ended up drifting off. Well the medicine alarm went off and I jumped up trying to figure out why it didn't go off at 7 a.m. like usual. I rummage through my clothes looking for scrubs to wear, freaking out because it's going to be busy this morning at work. I was almost all dressed when I noticed my computer said 8 p.m. I just needed someone to know this.Last week I was sharing a hostel room with only one other person. He turned off the light to go to sleep, climbed into bed, and then started asking me questions about my life. We talked about our lives, our countries, his divorce, my future, politics, being a woman vs a man traveling, etc. None of it ever crossed the line or made me feel uncomfortable. 

We talked for hours, and I never even saw his face, since there was furniture between us and the lights were off. I think that helped us both be completely honest in our answers and emotions. It was just one of those experiences that will stick with me for a long time. I was getting ready to check out at the grocery store last week and I (26f) saw this little girl (7f) just kind of minding her own. She had a very timid / shy vibe and I for some reason kept looking at her. 


I realized she had almost the same birthmark that I did, almost in the exact same spot. So I go up to her and kind of squat down to her level and I asked 


“Excuse me miss....is that a birthmark?” 


I can see her father kind of prepare for something mean or rude to come out of my mouth. 


And she kind of whispered “....yeah” 


And I flipped my hair so fast and got super excited and said “OH MY GOSH WE ARE BASICALLY SOUL SISTERS LOOK I HAVE ONE TOO AND IVE ONLY MET ONE OTHER PERSON WITH THE SAME ONE. DO YOU BELIEVE HOW SPECIAL THIS IS? YOURS IS EVEN COOLER THAN MINE!” 


And I watched her face light up like it probably never did before, I saw myself in that little girl when I asked her if that was her birthmark. She was also preparing for me to say something mean. Kids used to tease me up and down over it. Now I hardly notice it but as soon as I got excited and got up close and showed her the left side of my face she was thinking it was cool instead of thinking it was existing to be teased about. 


Her dad stood behind her and mouthed “THANK. YOU” and made a heart with both of his hands and I left. I got to my car and cried. I hope nobody teases her. She had an astronaut toy and she could be in space one day. No need to hurt that brain.



EDIT: you guys! This was an awesome first day on Reddit! I didn’t expect this to blow up but I’m so glad it did! Thank you for letting me share my joy with you all. (I still don’t know what to do with the coins you guys gave me, or how to post a picture of my birthmark!)


DOUBLE EDIT: 


[birthmark pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/VJwafF9)She happily identifies as a girl. 11 years old and she needs no explanation for these things - I asked one time, after she drew two women characters having a kiss, if she thought she might fancy girls. She said she didn’t care. I said that was cool. 

She told me a couple days ago she’s so excited because this guy asked her on a date. Used to be a girl. None of her friends care, none of our family care, no one cares because it’s just two young kids excited to dance at a disco together. 

Makes me so happy. My family are so liberated - my mother helped her get ready and encouraged her excitement etc. Not a care in the world. I feel so lucky.

Edit to say - there seem to be a lot of negative comments on this post! So just to clarify, at this age, the other kid won’t be able to have any irreversible changes to their biological sex. Just stuff that doesn’t matter like cutting hair and wearing typical ‘Male clothing’. They are also not ‘dating’ in the sense that many people have interpreted it! They went to a school dance together. They are about to transition from primary to secondary school - it’s just like a ball. 

At the end of the day; all we want is my sister happy. She was super excited to have her hair and nails done (just painted with some plain polish before you all start freaking out lmao) and just go to this school dance with someone she’s been friends with for years. Some people aren’t so open minded or liberal in their thinking which is very apparent in this thread! For some context I am actually a straight cis female, we have a straight cis brother and this is new for my mum -don’t assume (like some people below) that we are are pressuring her in any way. We want her to know our family is a safe space where she can discuss her thoughts and feelings without judgement. It’s important to us that if she feels like she wants to discuss anything like this as she grows up she doesn’t feel restricted or nervous. Please don’t be so unpleasant and unkind. There’s enough nastiness in this world!I've been smoking for 10 years. I tried quitting multiple times, but to no avail. This time, however,  I did it. I miss it, and there are some activities that trigger my need for nicotine, but it's easier and easier to ignore it. So yay me :D

Edit: You guys, I was showered with messages of love and support all day. I really appreciate you all, and wish you all the best. I spent a few hours today reading every single comment, and I'm sorry I didn't reply to all. It was overwhelming. Thank you, again, for your support and kind words. You guys are awesome. Day 11 has just ended, and there were no cigarettes today either :)She was struggling to find a job that is related to her engineering degree for years and the pandemic didn’t help. This is her first real job that is related to her degree and now she’ll be in the front line to help overcome this pandemic. I’m super excited for her! 

Edit: thanks the strangers for all the awards! And thanks everyone for the supports! Some of y’all are curious about which company, it’s Fujifilm Diosynth, a CDMO, that partners with a lot of other biotech companies to mass manufacture materials, including vaccines. They’re just partnering up with Novavax to manufacture a Covid-19 vaccine candidate. 

I included the link to the company here for some of y’all that want to know more about the company. 

https://fujifilmdiosynth.com/about-us/news/novavax-and-fujifilm-diosynth-biotechnologies-initiate-large-scale-manufacturing-of-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/I see quite a few posts, in various subs, where people post a photo they took, a drawing they made, or an idea they had, and they are often downvoted and picked apart mercilessly.

I’m not suggesting every post be upvoted, or that we give out participation awards for showing up. 

All I’m suggesting is that we all remember that there is a person on the other end of that little post, who is likely refreshing their profile, just waiting for that little bit of validation. It’s so easy to think “meh, not bad” and keep scrolling without dishing out the upvote. 

Your upvotes cost you nothing, and they are not so precious as to require a mastery to deserve one.

We live in a world that is simultaneously ultra-connected and incredibly disconnected. One little upvote on a post with one or two, could make someone’s day – and encourage them to continue trying... and improving.

**Edit**: I’m sure nobody will ever return to a post they’ve awarded, but just in case: thank you for all the awards.

Apologies for the typo in the title.

There are some great comments and interesting perspectives below – I highly recommend checking them out!I got a call from the Department of Health in my state yesterday saying that I've been exposed to a positive case for the virus. As such I have been asked to self-quarantine for 14 days, and therefore am limited to staying in the bedroom as much as possible. My mom is currently at physical therapy to help her recover from hip surgery, and my dad is at work because he can't afford to stay home as he is our only source of income and they wont let him work from home. It's just me and my little sister, and she mostly keeps to herself. A few minutes ago she called up the stairs and asked if I wanted lunch. A little confused, I said I would like cereal, Honeycombs if we had them. She then asks if I want milk in my cereal, because she usually has her cereal dry and the milk separate, but she knows I'm not like that. I say yes, I would like milk. A few minutes later she calls up the stairs, "Sam your lunch is on the banister." I get my mask on and go down the stairs to the bottom where a bowl of Honeycombs with milk was resting on the flat-topped pedestal thing that marks the end of the handrail. I bring it upstairs, and the dog pushes the door open and jumps up on the bed because I have food. My little sister goes to close the door, stops just before her hand touches the doorknob, pulls it back and wraps her hand in the end of her shirt, then closes the door with the shirt acting as a barrier. She asks if I need anything else. I say no. She says, are you sure? I say yes. She goes into her room.

This is extremely uncharacteristic of my antisocial sister, who almost never does anything for other people without being asked. She truly is a precious thing who loves me very much and I couldn't be more grateful for her. I don't know what I'd do without her. She's the best. Shout out to my awesome little sister, Autumn!
I'm not even just talking about the news. Every book I pick up, every show on Netflix, every movie is set in America. I'm just so bored of it. 

Like, what about the rest of Europe? Where's my superhero stories in France? How about some media that focuses on Norway's many folktales?

I'm an Aussie and I never see stories about Australia unless it's some Crocodile Dundee garbage.

I think I'm really frustrated with the lack of cultural variety in media tbh.

EDIT: Okay so to clear some things up, I watch a LOT of films, and yes I watch a lot of foreign stuff in subtitles. I'm sorry it's not clear, but I'm frustrated that the industry is so saturated in American media, not that foreign films don't exist.  A lot of people keep saying, 'just don't watch American stuff' but that's not my point. I'm sick of seeing the overall film industry as 'American media plus a little bit of everything else.'

I appreciate all the recommendations and there's been some really interesting stuff being recommend, and while that's appreciated, that wasn't the point of my post.

And yes, I know anime exits.

EDIT2: I love y'all (except for that random twat who sent me a DM saying I was racist to white people) I've done my best to answer as many of you as I could but it's 3:00am and I'm really tired. I'll get back to y'all in 9 hours.Give yourself a pat on the back. You made it through yesterday and I just wanna give you a reason to keep going. Upvotes for everyone. Every comment gets one from me.

Thank You for the awards.

Update: I will eventually get to upvoting everyone.
- AlizséPretty much what it says. I think Reddit’s default setting is actually a pretty cool thing. It suggests that we should value our own voice and that what we do, say, and are is worthwhile.

I know there are a lot of people around on here that might struggle with such issues and I just thought it be worth pointing out that these little tiny things can be meaningful if we let them :)I was laid off five weeks ago from a job I love.  Initially, I was sad but not too worried since I worked in the tech space and almost immediately I had recruiters reaching out to me.

Then the virus hit, and all my job leads dried up.  All of them.  I'm now unemployed going into a recession.  And there's so much I'm worried about - my lease is up in June and I have to move, but where do I move if I don't have a job? I have an autoimmune disease but the docs say it's well controlled for now so I shouldn't be at any greater risk (operative word: "for now").  My parents are older and I worry about them.  I'm in a city that was hard-hit by the virus and I haven't seen friends in over a week so I'm pretty lonely too.

I took the GMAT yesterday.  This is a test I scheduled over a year ago and have been studying for diligently since.  The testing center wouldn't let me reschedule without paying the $250 fine so I decided to take it anyway.  I was expecting around the 650 range which is good enough, nothing special though.

I scored 740.  It's the 97th percentile.  It's the average score to be admitted to Harvard Business School and it's high enough to qualify me for financial aid at many programs I was looking at.  I'm shocked.  I took the GMAT to be a fallback plan in case my career ever stalls, but now it looks like I could actually go to a really good school, full time, with some aid.  Just wanted to share!

&#x200B;

EDIT I: I was not expecting this to blow up!  I guess we all needed to to hear a little good news today.  Thank you all for your well-wishes and kindness.  It is kindness that will get us through this hard time and I wish the best for you all and your situations.

EDIT II: Since someone in the comments asked...I'm looking for product manager roles in the Boston area.  I have experience on web & app, B2B & B2C, mostly customer-facing products.  If anyone has a lead for a job I'm happy to DM my linkedin!I’ve been looking forward to this for awhile. Didn’t realize today was the day though since days blend together now. It’s my first cake day and I’m kinda sad I missed it. Bummer. 

Anyways, has anyone else missed a cake day before? How is everyone? Feel free to comment anything on this post. Something that made you smile, a recipe, whatever. 

Thanks for reading my lil post.

EDIT: yo I didn’t expect so many to comment on this. Even though I was bummed, that feeling went away. I wanna say thank you to everyone who has liked and commented on this post. Also I got two awards? That’s fancy now. Thank you to whoever did that. Y’all are awesome and so friendly. So once again, thank you for making me smile and chatting with me. Gonna head to bed (and hope that this post doesn’t get marked as “abandoned”). Much love. 🤙🏻❤️

EDIT #2: wow. I woke up and this just blew up. Hold on guys. Y’all don’t have to keep giving upvotes and awards. Apparently I learned about the entire “farm for karma” thing. I don’t even know what to use karma for (or what). And apparently coins are different than karma. Idk. All I know is I made this post because I wanted to just chat with the one or two people who would possibly comment on here. Just wanted to chat, not get anything in return besides a conversation. So my B if this struck a cord with some people. Not sure why it would make y’all angry, but that wasn’t my intention. 

And also, I wasn’t completely distraught over this. I was a lil bummed because I was looking forward to it. That’s all. I know it’s not important in the long run. It didn’t completely ruin my day. So I’m good. Just was a lil bummed and wanted to reach out to people. That’s all. 

Not sure how reddit works with the notifications. I though your cake day lasted til midnight, yet apparently mine lasted for more than 4 hrs after posting this? Idk. I’m just here at this point. 

So once again, thanks to everyone who messaged and commented. It’s been wonderful chatting with y’all. I tried my best to reply, but things got outta hand. Thanks to that one person who posted a chocolate chip recipe, I can’t wait to try that. And to the person who got creative and posted links to a vid and cake images, that made me laugh. Just thanks to everyone. Y’all have a wonderful day.I've been on this plan for years after we broke up, I guess because there's 5 spots on the family plan and only 3 of them so they never noticed. 

Regular Spotify is so shit I had no idea. I hope that my next girlfriend's family can help me.

Edit: everyone offering me Spotify plans is a pure goddamn angel. Seriously you make the world a better place just by existing. I have a Spotify now but keep spreading that love!I posted an ad on gumtree for casual babysitting a week ago. I am currently working with a company in child safety and NDIS (disability work). When I posted the ad, I thought I’d be helping out parents who wanted to go for dinner occasionally. 

The responses I have had are from people with disabled children and family members, who want me to support their loved ones with their weekly needs. This afternoon, I finished my first shift with a toddler who needs 24 hour care. After this shift, I was surprised to receive a call to assist an older man who has an inoperable brain tumour and needs help twice a week to maintain his active and social lifestyle. 

I’m really proud of myself. All I’ve ever wanted to do was help people, and I’m finally doing it. 

Thanks for reading :)

Edit: I’m trying to reply to everyone, it’s just taking some time! Thank you all so much.I just wanted to share this with someone
it honestly feels surreal to look at the mirror and see the best version of myself by far, and the only thing that keeps me going during these sad state of affairs are the surprised faces of all of my acquaintances when I see them next

Use this time (if possible) to catch up on all those things you stored up in the attic of your mind, for "later".Whenever I subscribe to a hobby sub I end up unsubscribing soon after because there's always this mentality that if you're not sinking huge amounts of money into it, then you're doing something bad. I was subscribed to /r/woodworking a few years ago and posted pictures of a wooden box I was making for my then-girlfriend. It was made out of plywood I had laying around my house, and it looked nice. But I got a barrage of downvotes and people saying I didn't give a shit about my girlfriend because I wasn't using nice wood. Sorry, didn't mean to offend you by being broke. And I just unsubscribed from /r/vinyl because people were talking shit after I had the gall to admit I have a cheap record player that I'm ok with for now, until I can afford a better system. These people are sinking $1000 into a setup, and I'm sure it sounds fantastic, but I gotta buy groceries too haha.

Edit: I just started a subreddit called /r/brokehobbies for elitism-free hobbying. Check it out if you're interested! Shoutout to /u/selfassuredcarnivore for giving me the idea!So I was adopted right when I was born, and my adoptive parents and I never really saw eye to eye on a lot of things. When I turned 18, I got in contact with my biological mother, and I found out that I had a 2 year old half sister, and I planned to meet both of them for lunch, but I never heard from her again. There was about three emails sent back and forth, with very little information. It seemed to be and acknowledgement to each other that we existed, and not much connection.

In the following 9 years, I graduated with two degrees, got married and divorced, started transitioning, and lived what feels like five lifetimes in 9 years. However, my adoptive parents were very toxic and my mental health got bad enough that I checked myself into a mental hospital. I've been out for a month, and decided to block my adoptive family from ever contacting me again, which has been one of the best decisions I ever made!

However, yesterday I received an email from my biological mother saying she was sorry for disappearing 9 years ago, and she was hoping to reconnect. I emailed back, and we texted and video chat and she told me that she was going to start telling her family about me (27 years after I was born) and started off by telling my half sister about me, who always wanted a sibling (just like I wanted one). We've already video chatted, and are planning to meet up soon as she's coming down to Florida with my half sister when they visit family. I woke up yesterday with zero family, and by the time I went to bed yesterday, I had a whole new family who I don't have to hide from, and who accepts me for me. I just feel like shouting this to the world, but I figured a post on here had the same effect!

Quick Edit: Thank you for the awards, and thank you for the support! To the people who are telling me that I was wrong to cut out my adoptive parents, it was a decision that was a year in the making and a lot of therapy appointments helped me come to the conclusion to do what I did!

[Update!](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/j66r9x/update_my_biological_family_connected_with_me_for/)I was in a stationery shop today that sells funky note books. Some of the covers have funny sayings and quotes and a few of them have swear words. All the swear words are covered with stickers. A young child asked her mom why there were stickers and her mom said it’s because there are rude words underneath. The child asked what it said. And the mom plainly said “it says bitch” the child asked “what’s a bitch” and the mom replied “a disrespectful term for women” and then they moved onto a different section of the store. The mom was so honest and didn’t even mind when her child four your old child said bitch. I hope to be as open with my kids and educate them so honestly one day.Because of covid-19, I only just returned to school today. My birthday was last month so when I finally met up with one of my close friends she gave me a gift - a beautiful notebook with a small personal note that was adorable. I thanked her and we continued about our days.

I was waiting alone for my bus to arrive and decided to have a better look at the book. Inside, it had the most heartfelt message I have ever received, telling me to follow my dreams and that she was so grateful to have me in her life. All throughout the book are little notes and drawings that are all connected to us - inside jokes, mutual hobbies - and I just can't believe it. I started crying without even noticing. I feel so loved and I wish I could repay her for all that's she's done for me. I'm going to keep it forever.I don't know why I always like the way the air feels and the feeling I get before a storm. What is that? Does anyone else feel like that? Why?

Edit: Glad I'm not alone here, sorry I'm not able to converse with everyone. Funny how something offhand like this gets a lot of engagement but when I ask a really obscure important question on here about my ass warts everyone pretends like they don't see it. He mocked my entire existence by calling me a “lowly cashier”, while asking me patronizingly and with venom dripping from his voice, “is this your career? When do you plan on retiring?” I did nothing to provoke this vitriol. I’m by no means perfect at work, but this interaction began and ended with me being completely friendly and professional, aside from at one point asking him “man, what is your problem?” 

I’m a 30-year-old woman just trying to get by and live my life. I don’t really feel proud of my job, especially since I grew up a smart kid in the US, where the plan of attending college and moving onto a well-paying or personally-gratifying career was drilled into my consciousness from a young age. This isn’t really how I anticipated my life at 30. That being said, I don’t feel ashamed of my job either. I am 100% self-sufficient and I have been since the age of 22. 

It was wild for me to think about how this man and I were both leaving this conversation having the exact same thought about each other: “What an absolute loser!”

I can’t really boast my achievements or my accolades, but I try my best to be a kind person. At the very least, I can say with confidence that I’ve never once tried to ruin a stranger’s day or self-esteem. What a bizarre way some of us have of measuring success.While driving home today, I saw a kid (maybe 10–11 years old) waving at cars passing by on our small rural street. He was selling lemonade, something I haven’t seen in years! My house is only a short walk up from his, so when we got home my friend and I got our masks and walked down to get lemonade with our outdoor cat in tow. 


After not speaking to any new people in like 4 months because of quarantine, my social anxiety kicked in and I was suddenly terrified of walking up to a kid and asking for some lemonade, so I made my friend promise to start the conversation. It was so nice! He loved seeing our cat on a walk with us, and I realized all the proceeds were going to the local animal shelter (and a sign that read “Any tips go to me :)” ). It was only $1 for two amazing lemonades, but I gave him $4.50 (all the cash I had) because I knew how excited I would have been to get that at his age. 


After getting more and more depressed during quarantine, that little moment was what I needed to remember how many little good things there are in life :) I hope you all had a good day too!This is the best I have ever done in my life, of any essay. I struggle with academic writing, and I’ve never got more than a C+ in it at uni, and at school I hardly got more than a B.
I worked so so hard on this dissertation and the results came out today. I’m so happy. I don’t have many friends but today I just want everyone to know.
I’m so proud of myself and I feel so relievedSo recently I’ve been thinking about how normally I would get sick once or twice every few months. But during this time we’ve been quarantined for covid I literally haven’t gotten sick once (like a normal cold)!! I know this obviously makes sense but it just dawned on me how effective social distancing can be even for a regular cold! Guess that means I'm lonely? It's 100% true tho, I am lonely. I always just get a warm feeling inside when I interact with sometime in my posts. I always like making new friends. I just like being happy with others.   





Does anyone else get that feeling?It's like a freaking title like doctor or professor. It's your fifteen mins when you have a platform. Everyone involved is there to discuss something you brought up. Anytime someone asks a question directed towards the OP, you feel special because there ain't no other OP there - you're the OP! 

The flip side to this is of course, if your post is getting downvoted. Then it feels like a dark spot on your otherwise good history. Or worse, when the post is really upvoted but everyone just downvotes anything the OP says for some reason. That has not happened me yet, but I have seen it happening and dread the situation. 

Why the heck do I care?!? And does anyone else feel all this?

Edit: wow you all! Thanks for all the love! It's good to know so many people feel the same way! I am going to be feeling pretty cool for a while 😎

Hope to cross paths with you in your OP moments! Take care everyone :)Like when I upvote and it goes from 899 to 900 or 776 to 777. Sometimes I upvote just to make the number look nicer. Does anyone else feel this way? Nice numbers are nice.Life plays weird tricks on you sometimes. First i was depressed when i lost my job because this would be the absolute worst time for me to have no job, then i get a call from the agency who got me the previous one. The medical service hotline need staff now, usually they are really picky but now it's my chance and it's better paid, i don't have to worry that my contract won't get renewed every year, it's much easier, and they pay into a fond that i have since 20 years, which gives me pretty amazing interests. In addition i get a permission to leave my house during quarantine because i'm essential staff for Healthcare. I'm quite confident i will get it.

Update: just finished the interview and did a test-case answering, i actually got the job! Thx for all your kind words, i really wasn't expecting this post to blow up like this. The thought that so many people wished me luck and hoped that i get the job actually calmed me alot during the interview. I'm sorry for everyone who lost his job recently and wish you all good luck at finding new ones, and that they are even better than your previous ones like in my case. Still, everyone of us should push over goverments to take care of not just the companys, but also the citizens who suffer financially under this virus. Not everyone will be as lucky as i was, and it's a shame that many goverments let people alone with this. But no matter how bad it might look for you now, it will surely get better. Let's remember this is the time where we need to take care of each other, to be kind and help those in need. Those who can't take care of themselves now like people with no work, elders, handicapped or parents without someone to look after their kids, but especially those without home and the refugees that a trapped in camps are now more than ever in need of our help. Stay healthy and much love to all of you!

Update 2: since many of you are asking for the job details or the company: first i live in germany, so if any of you are actually from here, i can dm you the company name IF the company actually still needs people, because it was implied that i already had to kick someone out of his slot of this topic, seemingly my personal interest in medicine gave me an advantage. For people of the US: i was mailed from someone who does the same job in the US, contact me and i give you informations about this or the persons name if he agrees so we can see if we can help you guys getting a job like this. The way it worked for me that i applied via an german job site for an job as customer support in call centers. I didn't realize it was an agency, which i usually avoid because they take only people who collect social security in 99% in the cases because thats how they get paid by the state. I was invited because they charge the companys instead of the state, and they introduced to a company that serves insurance companys, but was fired before it even started because of the corona virus and the office closing. They would rehire me later they said, but the next day this lovely guy from the agency already told me about the corona virus hotline. I looked for jobs like this, just to see if the qualifications or something like that really are as exclusive as he said, but couldn't find anything. Seemingly the agency was the only chance of getting this job at least in my case, and afaik they don't need more people.When I was between the ages of 11 and 15 I attended an art camp in the summer for two weeks. I learned some great skills and met some awesome people. One of my friends (who I had a crush on) was a few years younger than me and we spent every day together. Even in the midst of my socially awkward phase, I was able to find a like-minded individual who enjoyed my company. But unfortunately this was shortly before the days of social media and we didn't keep in contact.

Tonight I was thinking about my past at camp. I remembered him and I wanted to type his name into google and see what popped up. I wasn't expecting anything. And to be honest I barely remembered what he looked like. All I knew was that he was African American and was from Detroit.

So I typed in his name and nothing came up. I then added Detroit along with his name and an article appeared. I clicked on it and I found him. I almost didn't recognize him at first but I knew it was him. And guess what? He got INSANELY good at art and his pieces are beautiful. He also won a $10,000 scholarship for his artwork towards college.

I'm so happy that he pursued his passion. I'm so happy that he stuck with it and didn't give up like I did. I'm so happy he won a scholarship towards college and is on his way to improving his life with something that he loves. I wish I could congratulate him and tell him how proud I am.

Edit: WOW, this blew up which I wasn’t expecting. Thanks for the pineapple friend! Happy I could provide a positive story for others to enjoy 🍍Not much to it, but I'm offically a licensed EMT and I'm super fucking pumped! I just wanted to share this with everybody because I don't think I've ever had to study as hard as I did for this test. Anybody else have some good news they wanna share?It was so surreal. She unexpectedly passed when I was 12 and I’m 18 now. I always heard of people having dreams about their loved ones who had passed all the time and I’d grow sad/jealous because I never got to see her in my dreams unless it was a nightmare. 

Yesterday I was really missing her a ton and it hurt. But when I went to sleep, in my dream I got a phone call from her and I could hear her voice as clear as day. Of course my first instinct was to cry but she told me not to. she said to just talk to her instead and take advantage of what little time we had. 

I got to tell her all about the state of the world,
college, getting my first job, senior year, my first boyfriend, and how much I’ve changed. We had an actual conversation. She told me how proud of me she is, and that she’s happy for me. To keep going, and stay strong. 

I hope she comes and visits me again soon :)

edit: wow! i posted this and then went to work. i just got a second to look at my phone and - of course - i’m crying again. it’s so sweet hearing how many people can relate and have had such sweet experiences with dreams. thank you all so much for the love and support. for those of you who are grieving, my pms are always open, id love to talkOur caterers bailed at literally the last minute (yes, I am getting a refund). They're a local couple who started a catering business a few years ago and I think, basically, their marriage imploded that morning and he phoned my (now) husband in tears telling him they weren't coming at about quarter to two. The ceremony began at three. 

My first impressions of them were that they were a bit useless but honest and we'd been to an event they catered so I knew they were good cooks and they had good reviews... they *were* completely useless but they were honest about it, so I got that part right anyway. I do feel sorry for them - I really think that their marriage fell apart and he was in tears when he phoned. They've agreed to refund the money but asked for a bit of time as things are tight at the moment and I'll keep an eye on my account but that's a thought process for another day. 

So, we had to arrange food with literally no notice by ringing friends and asking them to run round the supermarket on the way there (remember, the ceremony was in an hour) and just bring what they could carry and they did an outstanding job. They grabbed literally anything they could that was ready to serve.

Telling my mother was honestly the most stressful part because she looked like she was about to explode but I did not have the mental space to deal with that so I just said very loudly that *it's fine now and it's sorted and we're not getting stressed* to which she replied "no, we're not going to get stressed". 

She was a caterer for years (but retired from it) and I helped her out a lot, so we basically managed the logistics of it all and formulated the quickest plan in the history of really quick plans... and it was fine. Between her, my friends who ran into the nearest supermarket and picked up as much as they could carry and my other friend who immediately took charge of serving the drinks... it all worked. 

We, miraculously, had bought some paper plates, paper napkins and recyclable plastic forks for the cake and the venue manager (who was doing it on her own!) was literally going through the cupboards for anything she could lend us. She was amazed at how we weren't having a nervous breakdown about it.

At least it was only 30 people, I guess. Plague restrictions meant the numbers had to be low, which was actually okay because we were no longer obliged to invite certain people so it was very much a Greatest Hits of our friends and family. 

We have already had to reorganise the wedding to varying extents *four times*, so getting here has been a bit of a journey, but I am now married and everyone had a good time and it was all okay in the end. 

A slow stream of photos is arriving via whatsapp, email and bookface messenger. Need to go to the bottle bank tomorrow. 

So, if you're planning a wedding and stressing out over chair covers and seating plans and what to feed your guests - don't worry about it. It'll be fine. At least your caterers will turn up. 

And if they don't... at least you'll get a story out of it.

Edit: My brother found this post so I want to also add that he did a really nice job with the flowers and I'm really grateful for his help.

Errata: You're all so sweet. Social distancing was enforced and masks were worn, for those who were wondering. No brides involved; two beardy grooms. My resplendent husband was sorting out the guests, who were arriving. Turning inbox replies off now. Thank you for all the positive energy!I took a hard two hour nap today in the guest room. When I woke up I had to remember where I was, who I was, what day it was etc. What a crazy feeling. That nap felt so good too.I finished paying off my $35,000 in student loans last night. I'm 25, I've been working my ass off for the past 2 years, sending half of my paycheck every month to them. I've done weird things like accept odd jobs for free housing, lived outside the US for lower costs of living, and lived out of a literal backpack. But I did it, I'm done, I can finally breathe and save again. I needed to tell someone because I don't want to rub it in to my friends still working on theirs, but I'm officially debt-free.

Edit: this post has blown up a bit so I wanted to clarify: Bernie 2020. Let’s make sure nobody else has to struggle for years to just break even. I want to be the last generation forced to sell our souls for education. We will all benefit from a more educated, more financially stable society.So, my husband and I have decided that it is time that our youngest (15) have some pocet money. Nothing much, 10 EUR.

His reaction shocked us. His words were: "Why are you offering me this? That is something completely new...I never had actual money with me. (he does have a school card with which he pays for lunch at school)
No, I must think about it. Having money is such a huge responsability!." 

We are both proud that we can comprehend the value of money but on the other hand we don't want him to be outsider when his friends go for a pizza or something...

He is still thinking about it and it has been more than two weeks since we made this offer.It all started because he told me he’s been addicted to buying cologne after I told him I’m addicted to buying clothes online because I’m bored at home with nothing to do. He’s been letting me smell his wrists with all his new cologne. 

Today I let him smell a new perfume I have and he said it smells so good and that he’s gonna bring me a small decanted bottle from his collection (he says it’s a unisex one). I told him if he does that, I’ll give him my number and he clicked his fingers at me and said “done deal.”

Edit 1: WOW! I woke up this morning to my humble post of 1,000 likes to this with so many little awards. I am humbled❤️ thanks for all the messages and replies, I’m going through them now. Also.. silver!!🥰

Edit 2: Will absolutely update you all when if I see him outside of work haha

Edit 3: This post was honestly to get people to see that it is possible to meet people who aren’t online and to start being chatty with someone. I don’t think the postman and I will have some kinda of amazing love story but it sure as hell is a funny story to tell my nieces and nephews one day. So, speak to a stranger today please and have a flirt!So, I used to watch that show "catfish" on MTV. Where people act as someone else on dating sites/Facebook and aren't who they really say they are. 
I was on Hinge (dating app) and started talking to a cute guy. We had great conversations and decided to meet up. When he showed up for dinner, he was WAYYYY more attractive than his pictures! He has lost about 45lbs since his pics on his profile and he is gorgeous! We laughed about how he reverse catfished me. We have now been dating 2 weeks and I REALLY REALLY like him. He is kind, caring, remembers little things I tell him and makes me laugh.

Just thought I'd share :)

Update:  1. Last night we went to a Rocketman themed costume contest and won! He made a great Elton and I made a great 1970s groupie!  2. No, this is 100% not an ad for Hinge. I had tried Tinder and Bumble before and didnt find what I was looking for. Downloaded Hinge and met Mr. Handsome Face 1 week later.  3. To all the haters saying women only care about looks, boooooooo. We have a super awesome connection, he makes me laugh, is patient and kind. THATS what matters to me. 4. Yes, I lost 120lbs so we bond over our weightloss journeys. I have sent the 2 page document that I used to shed the weight to several people today and would be happy to send it to anyone thats interested. :) Its just a list of "rules" and a list of what you can/cant eat. Please PM me if you're interested. 

Hope you all have a wonderful weekend!Some slightly inappropriate joking was happening in the kitchen while he cored a pineapple & made us a couple of drinks, and it ended up with us doubled over in laughter while our kids (7m, 2f) looked on in confusion. 

It seems silly and inconsequential, but moments like these make me insanely happy. That’s all. I’m just really happy. :)

Edit: obligatory “wow this blew up overnight” but man it really did! My most updooted post :) it’s gonna take a hot minute but I will respond to every comment! Thanks guys!A couple weeks after donating blood, I got something in the mail from the Blood donation place saying that I not only have O-negative blood, but I also have cmv negative blood. I had no idea what that meant but it turns out that people with O-negative/CMV negative blood can donate blood to anyone (O-neg) but also cmv negative blood can be used in babies. Babies that have health conditions, or those involved in traumas can only get cmv negative blood. And apparently only about 3% of the population has this blood type. I intend to start donating regularly. But I also feel really bad because in the past I would self harm and I can’t help but think about all the blood I lost and wasted. Maybe that’s silly but it’s how I feel. Anyways, I thought it was cool and that maybe I will end up being important in some little way to someone by donating the blood that could save a life.Sadly, our dog is being put to sleep in the morning. We made the decision earlier this week, and have spent the time since then making sure he's comfortable. We've been able to give him some of his favorite treats, but he doesn't have much of an appetite, and is generally avoiding solid food. Since his next favorite thing in life is human affection, we've obviously been absolutely showering him the past couple days, and I'm continuing that by staying with him overnight (I would've put him in our bed, but he usually doesn't stay up there for more than a couple hours before jumping down to his bed, and I'm afraid that he's too weak to make the jump since he's not really eating).

I don't want to go to sleep and miss out on any more time, so please help keep me awake.

Edit: thank you so much for all of your support everyone. It really means a lot to me, even though a lot of comments made me start crying again. I did fall asleep about 3 hours after posting, and just woke up about 4 hours later. We still have a couple hours with him, so we put him in our bed for a last quick nap there, and then we'll try some food and more snuggles.

Edit 2: thank you all so so much for the kind words and support, you are truly wonderful humans. Pierogi is at peace across the bridge now. I'll be trying to respond to everyone individually to keep my mind busy, but in the meantime please enjoy one of my favorite [pictures](https://imgur.com/gallery/T3lwfdT) of him.Since my childhood, labels like 'talented', 'naturally gifted', and 'intelligent' were given to me by my parents and relatives simply because I used to ace my school exams. My memory was decent, and scoring marks was a mere matter of memorizing the content, rather than learning and understanding. Receiving praise upon praise for this feat of memorization, I falsely believed myself to be a genius who could achieve any level of success without putting in much effort.

After graduating from school, I entered university in pursuit of a degree in Statistics. Gradually, day by day, my superiority complex shattered as I observed people who were actually intelligent, who could grasp and learn new concepts without breaking a sweat. These people were not only intelligent, they were also hard working. They kept learning and exploring things which were beyond the degree curriculum. Ironically, I found myself in the shoes of low scorers, whom I used to ridicule back in school. My superiority complex transformed into inferiority complex within a couple of months.

Then came the despair and clinical depression from not being able to understand concepts, scoring below average grades, and comparing myself to my classmates who had overwhelming academic & non-academic achievements. Throughout my degree I've struggled to learn. I've struggled in creating projects, which require applying your knowledge, and not mere memorization. I was forced to push myself everyday. Finally, I managed to complete my degree with a CGPA of 3.3/4.0

The shift from excellent grades of school to below average grades of college has changed the nature of praise that I receive. Now I get passive-aggressive comments like: "Yes, you scored kinda good because of your Intelligence/Talent, but you're not utilizing it to its full extent. You could do better if you worked a little". This pisses me off.

I learnt to respect hard work. I learnt not to look down on those who have low grades. I learnt that talented people do have a head start, but thats not an excuse (for talented people as well as normal people) for not working hard.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the supportive words and encouragement!Out of 140 applicants, all with business degrees, they chose me(?). A starving artist in my late 20's who's bounced around from job to job in every which field since I was 17. I've constantly been bartending and serving and going a week without meat to afford my rent, and now for the first time I've landed a full-time gig that is remote and mentally stimulating.

I'm ecstatic. I honestly can't even fully fathom what this means and how much this very well may change. I'm sorry to put this here but I really didn't want to put in on my social medias and then have all the conversations with distant family about "What are you doing in Canada now?!?"

EDIT: OK wow reception, hi. I thought, like, three people would downvote this and maybe somebody would say "Congrats your an adult" in a dry and evil reddit manner. Thank you. **Thank you**.

For the questions I'm getting about the job and the process, I wanna sum really quickly why I posted this: 

For those patient but determined, it's gonna happen. Keep trying, actively. This opportunity came to me through a photography Craigslist Gig that I found after literally searching the website daily for months because the pandemic closed my part-time job permanently.

Keep. Your. Heads. Up. And apply for everything. Put your name out there and LITERALLY SAY YES TO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.I’m sitting on the sofa, relaxing. In the kitchen, my 14 year old and 9 year old are making hamburgers for dinner - with a few instructions from me.
The day has arrived. My hard work has paid off. I am so darned proud of them!! 
Not only are they COOKING, but they are ALSO not fighting!
How did this happen?! :)I feel like each day is just pretty boring. I never really do anything very fun. I have friends, hobbies, and a good family. A lot of the time I just don’t know what to do to make me feel happy. Sorry for the pity post, just on my mind.

Edit: Wow! Thank you all so much for sharing your input and personal experiences. It means a lot to me. I hope you all have a great day :DSo my girlfriend's having a girl's night with her sister and friends and has had a few drinks. She's texted me with "We've been talking about the intricacies of life and honestly no conversation has made me happier to have someone like you by my side" seemingly out of nowhere.

Turns out they've been talking about things like monogamy and deep topics, and my girlfriend's so happy and satisfied with me that she's even offended at the thought of it. She's said that with me she can just be herself, that I never judge her, that I satisfy her emotionally and physically, and that I make everything better for her. She added on "you're the man for me" and "Do you know the 'get you a man that can do both' meme? It's like 'get a man that can do ALL"

I would like to think I'm a good boyfriend, but didn't expect her to feel so strongly about me. For context, we've known each other about ten years, and ever since we met I had a crush on her but never acted upon it. Somehow I won the lottery last year when things progressed between us and we started seeing each other - turns out she always had a crush on me too. Basically it's like when Jim finally got Pam, except in my case it was her that made the first move. I already felt super lucky to have her as my girlfriend before, but knowing how much both me and our relationship mean to her makes me even more grateful to be with her.

Also, I've had a few drinks and am on a vibe, so no one give me the "wait til the honeymoon phase wears off" bullshit, let a man be happyI'm putting clothes away and a happy memory popped into my head and i just had to share it. Myself, my husband and our son and daughter were in Old Navy getting pants for our son because school had started and turns out his old pants were getting too worn and they didn't fit him right anymore. Anywho..we find some pants and i go with him to the fitting room while my husband stays behind in the kids section with our 6 year old daughter. We come out some time after and walk back to the kids section to my husband standing looking like a coat rack, holding a couple of little girl dresses and blouses in his outstretched arm with our daughter talking his ear off about "i think this one is nice right daddy? but i like this color better.." "my friend has this exact same shirt i think" my husband nodding looking overwhelmed. She was just bouncing from here to there, oohing and aahing at the clothes with my husband following her. Then a look of relief when seeing me again and goes "what size is she again?....because i asked her and i don't think she's getting the right sizes..." I tell him and he goes "thank god..ok thats the sizes im holding then" We ended up telling my daughter we weren't in the store for her because she had plenty of clothes at home but she could pick three of her favorites from the bunch then we put the rest back.

But the sight of my poor husband clearly not in his element but trying his best for his little girl is one of favorite memories of those two <3 He doesn't even know it either lol

Edit: You’re all so wonderful, I loved reading all your own stories and experiences as fathers or about your fathers. As you all suggested, I’m going to tell my husband about this memory :)Seriously, this is agonizing! Plus it takes for-fucking-EVER because I keep finding ways to get distracted because folding the actual laundry is so boring.

EDIT: wow I didn’t expect this to blow up so much! Hands down my most upvoted post ever, thanks guys 

EDIT 2: I should probably clarify that I originally worded this poorly; it’s really the entire act of folding/hanging/putting away laundry in general that I hate 


EDIT 3: Thank you so much for the silver!! I drive 2 hours in the highway every few weeks and whenever I drive, there is always a car that I follow or they follow me and we never pass each other. When they finally go through an exit or I do, it feels like I just made a friend and makes me sad. Don't know if anyone does this or if it's just me.My wife started crocheting nearly 5 years ago, right after finding out she was pregnant with our daughter. She's come a long way with her products and how well she crochets. 

She sold $80 worth of her crafted products. She's struggled selling some stuff over the years and, at one point, had contemplated on quitting. 

I told her not quit and just keep doing what she's doing. I want her to be successful and this was her first step. She was so happy when she came home and told me how much she sold. 

Next step is trying to get her to market better and start attempting to sell her stuff online.

For those asking, [here](https://instagram.com/foreverhookedbyjess?igshid=1jxmetryzho50) is my wife's IG. It's not a professional one by all means, but she has quite a bit of stuff on there. She does take requests. She's made other products that aren't on her IG either. 

Edit: I'd like to thank everyone for the kind words, the recommendations and everything else. I apologize as Reddit has been a bit weird today and I haven't recieved notifications for anyone who's commented. Thank you all, again! I'll be showing my wife this post and all the kind words you all have shared!

Edit 2: Thank you to those individuals who awarded me! I also want to thank those who pointed out my grammatical error in the title. Grammar was never my strong subject, so thank you for pointing out my error. I will post a link/pictures once my wife gets that stuff ready. I'm surprised at how many supportive people are on here, thank you all!I'm still puzzled, I don't know why she did that. Took my car in this morning to get the tires balanced and rotated. The technician asked me for the mileage and I gave it to him. When he walked away my daughter asked “what does the mileage mean?” I explained it to her and it made me think how cool it is the way we learn stuff through our life. Such a trivial thing, but now I’ll always remember it as something I taught her. That’s all 😁OK, I must warn you that this is a long and strange story. Sit down, bust out the popcorn, and prepare to be underwhelmed. 

A year or so ago, I was sitting around watching youtube. I didn't have adblock at the time, so I was watching an ad for the Seat Toca (a car). There was a song in the background of this ad, and I *loved it*. The ad was only about 30 seconds long, but the song was bloody amazing. I was immediately determined to find this song. 

I started watching the ad on repeat, trying to figure out the lyrics so I could google the song and find it (my usual strategy). But nothing turned up. 

People in the comments section were discussing the song; several other people were trying to find it. Someone said it sounded like a guy called Mike something (I can't remember the full name of the artist). So I searched for Mike something, and went through a lot of his discography. But still - no luck. I tried searching his name + the lyrics, but... nothing. 

I tried using shazam. For those who aren't familiar, this is an app that uses the microphone on your phone to identify songs. The idea is that you play the song, turn on the app, and the app will tell you the name and artist of the song. But shazam was bloody hopeless, and couldn't identify the song. I downloaded the app, just for this one song, and deleted it when it failed me. 

At this point, I must admit that I was watching the 30-second ad once or twice a day, just so I could listen to the song, no matter how briefly. 

My next step was to *email the Seat marketing department*. I'm deadly serious, I actually did this. I sent a polite email, asking what the song was called. A few days later, I got a reply. The Seat employee told me that the song was a special commission for this particular ad, and wasn't available for general release. Essentially, it's not a real song, and there's no way to find it. 

I was heartbroken, but also felt a certain sense of closure. I popped back into the youtube comment section, and let everyone know about my findings. I had been keeping my IRL friends updated throughout this entire saga. They found it hilarious, and mocked me for the effort I was expending in order to find this song. I'm the kind of guy who can be very determined - if I want something, I'll put a lot of effort into getting it. This was just another weird project of mine, which unfortunately didn't work out. 

But so it goes. I moved on. I almost forgot about the song.

Fast forward to today, about one year after I originally heard the song. I get a random PM on Reddit. It's from a user I've never spoken to; a user who frequents subreddits that I'm not subscribed to. I have no idea who this person is. 

The PM simply said: 

>Song - Turn the lights down Artist - BSO

This song is on spotify, but not youtube or anywhere else. I made a spotify account, just to hear this song - if a random stranger PMs you a song, you have a duty to listen to it, right?

Well, I think you can all guess where this is going. Yes. Yes. IT'S THE BLOODY SONG! IT'S THE ACTUAL, LEGIT, FULL VERSION OF THE SONG!

I have no idea who that redditor is. I have no idea how they found me, and I have no idea how they knew about that song. I'm fairly sure I never mentioned it on Reddit. I send them a slightly crazed reply; a mix of utter gratitude and utter confusion. My reply read as follows:

>Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. I'm actually freaking out.

>Who are you? How did you know? WHAT IS GOING ON?

>Thank you so much. But also, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON

Their response was 

> Shh bby is ok

I shit you not. Never before have I felt such love for a total stranger. 

So, yeah. Wow. This is a pretty huge deal for me. 

For context, [here's the ad that started it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxkWhTrSPVI). The song is called "turn the lights down", by an artist called BSO. The full song isn't actually as great as I had hoped, *but that's not the point!*

Edit - I've just realised that this whole post might be construed as a pathetic attempt at viral marketing for Seat. So I want to state that Seat are a terrible company, their cars are awful, and they are capitalist pigdogs that do not deserve your money. 

Edit2 - [here](http://imgur.com/RX7aea0) is a screenshot of the PM.

Edit3 - last one, I promise. [here](https://i.imgur.com/GAJvnao.png) is the email from Seat. [Here](http://imgur.com/TXs2aNE) is the full unredacted PM conversation (I didn't want to post this until I knew /u/TheVikingHoward was comfortable with it). We're starting to get an idea of what might have happened, but I'm not gonna tell you here because it ruins the story. This is not a marketing campaign, I am not a member of BSO, and I did not fake the whole thing using alt accounts. Shh. For how truly hard a year it’s been I really needed a win and today went so well. My boyfriend, my pets and I are all piled on the couch watching TV bellies stuffed. The kitchen is relatively put back together, and plenty of leftovers and pie for breakfast. I made a full spread too, just for the two of us. I couldn’t be more thankful 

I hope those of you that have had bad Thanksgivings trust me when I say I feel your pain, and know just how lucky I am.
I was skimboarding on the beach the other day when I saw some white claws IN THE SAND DUNES, I wasn’t supposed to go there but I knew I had to pick them up, I think I did the right thing, I then saw a can down maybe 20 feet to the right so I went to pick it up, that’s when I just kept seeing cans and all kinda of garbage, the only reason I stopped grabbing trash was because I had to leave, from now on I’m gonna pick up trash when I’m at the beach rather then swimming, you people are messed up. There was a trash can 30 feet from the white claws, you had to pass them to leave sooooI was told after having my left temporal and occipital lobes removed in 2011 that I would most likely never be able to hold a job, let alone raise my children. It was very hard because I had to relearn a lot of things, but I finally started college in 2015. I was on the lowest level possible with classes, so it took me two and a half years without skipping a semester to get my associates degree. I had a 3.1 GPA. I got my Bachelor's degree in just a year and a half, getting a 3.7 GPA. I was able to get my kids back 2 years after surgery and even took in a foster child that I've adopted. So today is a big step for me and I'm very nervous. Can I please get some wishes for good luck?

Update: Thank you everyone for the kind words and message. I am in shock from all of the positive responses. I had my interview a little bit ago and I'm really not sure how I did. I feel like I could have failed it just because I got nervous with words and I did mess some up. However, I'm not going to let this affect me. It just probably means I'm not meant to work there but it's practice for the next job. I won't find out for 2-3 weeks but I'll update as soon as I find out. Thank you guys so much!

Edit: I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for all of the kind words. Even if I don't get this job, I will keep looking instead of giving up. I am very proud of myself for where I am but I am not perfect. I can type better than I can speak unfortunately, and that's a downfall. I'm going to practice though and try my hardest to get better. For those who feel down, don't give up on your dreams. You can do anything you put your mind to! If I could help you, I would!

Update posted on new post today. Thank you everyone for all of the pep talk.Today I was lighting a freshly-rolled joint to smoke out my window, like any other day. This joint was a beauty and I spent some time and detail rolling it myself. I was ready to smoke, listen to some music, and look out my window to stare into the city sights and hear the city sounds.

I live on the top floor of my apartment complex downtown and my window over looks a narrow alleyway. It was very windy and I as I went to light up, I fumbled the 1 gram joint (I was already high at this point) and dropped the chubby boi right out the window. Stunned, I rushed towards the window in peril and stuck my head out. I looked down out and immediately see some guy walking by the alleyway. The guy look ups, looks around, then picks the up joint and walks away. 

Weed straight fell outta the sky for that guy today. I wonder what he must have been thinking.So a little background on me.
I am the department head for security and safety at a zoo in the south and mostly the job is very relaxed compared to other places I've been in the past.

Usually the calls are about people not wanting to listen, or trying to feed the animals, or the occasional domestic issue.

Of course it is the south though and people can be.... very prejudiced to say the least.
I get calls all the time about a black, hispanic, indian, or arabic man "taking pictures of children" when that's never the case. They're just being racist.

Well I got a call on my radio about a guest being suspicious; walking around the zoo by himself with a bag.
I found the man and of course... he was middle eastern. 
I was frustrated but followed him from a distance just because I have to take all calls seriously, even if they're not.

I did notice the man... do something strange though.
He would reach in the bag and rumage around, then take it out and drop something in the grass next to the walking path.

I was confused, but it didn't look like trash so I just followed him for about ten more minutes. Eventually he threw the bag and the trash and continued through the zoo.
I stopped to look in the bag and... was surprised to say the least.

It was filled with empty flower seed packets.
He had been walking around trying to plant flowers which were indigenous to the area in the grassy areas without any further vegetation.

I had no idea what to say or think.

I thought it was beautiful.



Edit:

Wow I did NOT expect this to blow up. I was exhausted after work and decided to just share a little story.
Thank you everyone for the kind words and for introducing the term "Guerilla Gardening" to me.
That is a fun rabbit hole to go down.

Stay humble everyone, life is weird but the bright moments shine on.19 years ago my father met and married my stepmother. They only dated for like 3 months beforehand. My dad used to wear a lot of Hurley tank tops and my stepmom broke the ice by saying “what are you? Some kind of surfer dude?” Outside an AA meeting. 

5 year old me thought she was so cool. She played with me, and she had a dog. She took me to playgrounds and all kinds of fun places. It was amazing. 

It was more than I could ever say about my birth mother. My childhood with her consisted of extreme abuse, neglect, and an unsafe life brought on by her drug use. Spending more than 24 hours locked in a room with my infant siblings was a regular occurrence. My dad fought for custody for years but didn’t get full until I was 5. 

I remember the day I moved in with my stepmom. She showed me what would be my very own bedroom and took me to home depot to pick out what color I wanted to paint it. You would have thought I won the lottery. I jumped in her arms and told her I was never going to leave. I said I would bring my husband too and we would live in my very own blue room lol. 

The following two decades she did everything a mom should do. She came to my plays, stayed up when I was sick, brought me to skating lessons, picked me up from school when I couldn’t get my snow pants off in time and I peed my pants. She came and cheered proudly at my graduations. She’s answered 1,000 of my calls to help me work through problems, be a shoulder to cry on, the first to hear good news, and just to chat. She was even the first to listen to me scream and sob when I found out I became pregnant whilst going through a medical treatment that wouldn’t allow me to carry to term. She’s always been there as an unwavering support for me even on the worst days of my life. 

For her birthday I decided to get her the papers to adopt me and my brother. 

Today we went to the courthouse. Surrounded by friends and family who have gone on this journey with us over the last 20 years. We had a private ceremony with a full room and full of happy tears. 

I’m just so grateful to have her as my mom. She even got me a bracelet with today’s date and “Olet Rakas” (You are loved) inscribed. She thinks of everything. 

Thanks Katri for always being my mom. It feels good to have the paperwork in order. 

tldr: bio mom was a piece of garbage and I was raised since 5 by my wonderful stepmother. Today at 24 she adopted me.

EDIT: Wow y’all are so wholesome. My heart is so filled with love and I can’t even believe how our story has touched y’all enough to comment. Figured I’d spread a little more joy around-

[The moment after the paper was signed by Judge](http://imgur.com/XgCJHLD) 

AND 

[The bracelet ](http://imgur.com/xWJEvEq) 

The other bracelet she gave me for my 7th birthday so you know I’m wearing both until I die. 

Ps thanks for the gold!

EDIT 2: HOLY MOLY PEOPLE. I love this beautiful community. I am going to do my best to reply to all your questions, and I’ve read every comment. Hearing how some of you have been touched with choosing your own families has been incredible. I told my mom about this and she came out from being a lurker so let’s give some love to u/happyfinngirl. 

Lots of people are asking how we did this! I literally just walked into our local courthouse and asked for adoption papers. They gave us a lot of forms, we had to get some things notarized, but overall it was an easy process!

Once again I just can’t believe how touched people are by our story. When it’s your own life it’s hard to picture anyone looking in and saying “wow, that’s amazing!”. Life can be bad, life can be good. Even on our HARDEST days the world is full of loving people and reasons to be grateful. So you know what? My life is amazing. 

I want you all to think about the people that make living worth it. Think about the people that made you the person you are. Tell them you love them today. This world needs us to remember and celebrate the good. 

[Bonus picture of wedding day with all of us!](http://imgur.com/uVrgJjB)I was super nervous when the chef told me yesterday that he wants to talk to me with the so-chef because I'm new and I can't really keep up yet and I make a fair bit of mistakes.

Today he approached me and told me that a dish I made a few days ago as an experiment was really good and he wants it on the menu.

I  was stoked, half my shift I spent on making it better, he even told me to go buy whatever I need and to take the business credit card.


I got no one really to tell to, but I just wanted to tell someone.


It's my dream to become a chef, I'm a high school dropout and still very young but I'm doing what I love, and today for me was a proof I'm getting places.


Edit: just want to say thanks for all the kind words, really means a lot!I wanted to put it out somewhere. I just want these emotions I have expressed somehow, somewhere. 7 years, mental health struggles, so many interpersonal problems and financial drawbacks. But I did it. And it feels...... I can’t explain it. Damn.

Edit: I am genuinely so overwhelmed right now from all the love and support. To all the med students and doctors out there who have PMed me, please do not hesitate to ask me for help, or if you just want to talk. Everyone has their falls, and it is absolutely okay. I have been there, and failure is nothing to be ashamed of. You are extremely capable, and those moments do not define you. You got into med school on your own merits, so be proud! Now I’m gonna try and say thanks to EVERYONE in the comments because just.... wow. THANK YOU.It was a tough day. A good day though as my relationship was a broken one with my now exwife. But that simple act of kindness helped me smile and be grateful for even the small things. 

Edit: Thank you for the gold my friend. I dedicate it to human kindness. There have been times in my life where I haven't been so kind. Both to myself and to my exwife. (As you can read about if you follow the comments.) Although I am embarrassed by my previous indiscretions, unkindness, my past doesn't have to define my future. I'm excited for a new day and the opportunity to help my boys learn from my mistakes. Thank you everyone for your kind words and well wishes. My wife and I have been looking for a home to buy recently and we found one that we wanted to put an offer on. There were three other offers on the house so we would be in a sort of bidding war with the others but we figured we had a shot. I got a text from the realtor this morning saying that the buyers had gone with a different offer because it was cash and with no inspections. Half an hour later I get a call from my dad saying that he bought the house so we would not have to over pay. We will still have to buy the house from him, But he did all the inspections himself and is already setting up Sheetrock repairs and a few other things for the house. Housing market is near impossible to find anything decent right now, so this is a huge help. 

I know I don’t say it enough, and I will absolutely have to tell him later, but thank you dad. I love you so much.Edit: Just so people know, I'm a woman lol :)


My optometrist told me at my last visit in April that pressure build up has started in my eyes. And if I don't quit smoking like, now, I'll have Glaucoma in 2 years.

I'm 42.

So, I got Wellbutrin to help me quit, using patches AND a vape. May be overkill but I've been a heavy smoker for far too long and it's time I said "I'm done!"

So far, so good. 

The cravings have been minimal and not bad. I haven't even thought about stopping and grabbing smokes (my last pack etc) since last Monday.

I'm finally ready and doing it!

Anyone else have success stories? Doesn't have to be about smoking :)

Edit: First of all, thank you all for your words of support and congratulations! Reddit can be really toxic but then threads like this happen. 

I appreciate every one of you who posted and wished me luck, or said you were proud. I also thank you for sharing your stories with me!!!

And thanks for the awards! I've never recieved so many!!

Edit 2: Holy Shit!! Thanks for the upvotes, awards and comments! I decided last night to stop the patch. More than a few comments mentioned that and I took it to heart. Thank you for those words of advice.

No more patch. Going to drop down the nicotine % in my vape and go from there.

Thank you again! The positive reinforcement has been so helpful, and all who've shared their quit stories, whether cigarettes, alcohol or drugs. I 100% appreciate you all

One last edit: I ordered the Allen Carr book. Seeing so many recommend it tells me it has to be good!I don't have anyone to share this with so I'm sharing it with you guys. 
It's weird but duolingo kept my sanity in 2020 😅. 

I am so proud of myself. 
Gonna have a solo dance party now ✨🤩🥳



Edit: Thank you so much for the awards!!! I've never gotten one before! Made my day!!! 🥰

Edit 2: I'm studying for an exam right now (unrelated to languages), but I will try to reply to everyone (eventually lol)

Edit 3: guys. How did this post get such a big response?? 😂 This is crazy. Thank you so much everyone! I hope this post motivates you to start doing what you always wanted to do, whether it's learning a new language or a hobby or more serious things. You can do it!

Edit 4: the number of upvotes is ridiculous. This must be how Beyonce feels every day. I peaked on reddit in 2021 lol gonna tell my grandchildren about thisNight shift in an Amazon FC.. just wanted y'all to know that I try to get your stuff to you in good condition.  of course production numbers have to be met, so you get people who might send off an item that has crushed packaging or that is otherwise crappy, just to keep the numbers up and not lose those units.   rest assured that i will absolutely take the hit and get it fixed.     it seems like everything in the news about working for amazon is negative.   its hard work, yeah, but they tell you that before anything else.  we do trivia, win prizes, have raffles.  i don't feel like its a bad gig, and i've had a few of em.

&#x200B;

edit: had to clock some sleep!  I appreciate the appreciation and hope you all have a good holidayI’ve had really low self esteem for as long as I can remember and I’ve just always felt like nobody really likes me and they’re just trying to be nice and stuff. Usually when people try to compliment me I don’t believe them because from my perspective I don’t see how anyone in their right mind could think that.

But anyway, I’d heard bits and pieces of this before, but I was up at 2am with two friends on a call and we were asking each other questions and they pretty much directly told me that everyone really respects me and that most of our friend group looks up to me and it just really warmed my heart, especially to hear from two people who are usually brutally honest about stuff. At one point I was asking them who they would consider their biggest inspiration/role model and one of them said me and he told me that every time I text him and say I’m working out it motivates him to get up and work out and eeeeeeeee it just makes me so happy that I’m having such a positive influence on other people

Edit: thanks for all the wonderful comments everyone! I don’t have the time to go back through and reply to each one individually but I’ve read all of them and they’re so wholesome and I appreciate all of you so much :DLook, I love my family and they're awesome. But, sometimes, I need to be alone. I like being alone. My relatives have been living with me for a while now (ever since March, can you guess why?) and as someone who's been living alone for a while now it's getting pretty hard.

I told my parents, uncles, and grandparents the truth. I bought a new book and it has just arrived, but I still haven't had the chance to read it because of them. There's no peace and quiet around them. They're the party hard kind and I'm more introverted.

We haven't left the house in months, I really need this. I spent the day cleaning up after them because one of my two uncles insisted on making breakfast. Honestly, yeah, it was good. But, damn, no pancakes are worth that mess. He did help me, but I'm just so tired. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. After we were done with the dishes, I turned on my computer and booked a room for three days.

I check in tomorrow at noon. Really looking forward to it.

For those who have asked for an update: I went to my room, it does have a bathtub (shout-out to the guy that told me to call the hotel and see if I could get one, I didn't even get charged for it). I wanted to swim, but it was really cold so I lifted some weights and then just jumped in the pool. Didn't last very long in there, though. Now I'm just doing nothing, relaxing, and listening to music. Turning off my phone for some long long hours.After a while of trying, my Fiancé is pregnant and I’m the happiest man in the world, I have no close friends to tell and I needed to get this of my chest!!My girlfriend is a mother of a beautiful and wonderful 3 year old girl. Yesterday when I woke up I went down stairs to get some coffee and was suspiciously told to wait in the hallway for a period of time. When given the all clear I had my coffee and was given a bag with my gift and a card. The card read," you're not a step dad, you're a dad who stepped up." I cried for so long. So this is an appreciation post for all the fellow step dads out there. Happy (late) Father's Day.Last year on this day, I decided to quit both Facebook and Instagram for good, They were just a huge factor in contributing to my low self esteem and depression and i realised that all that happens there is simply a highlight reel full of fakeness. So instead i decided to relocate all the time and energy spent on them to being more productive! I started reading more, learned 2 levels of German and re-ignited my love for drawing.

I just had to tell someone and i can't wait to see what the upcoming years will look like when i continue down this path!

Edit: Thank you for the awards kind strangers!It all started when I started to drive. I was 26 when I got my Learners (I know but I just didn't feel ready, okay?) Anyway, when I started driving with my instructor - I noticed something with my eyes.

I noticed that I couldn't see the road signs until I was right on top of them. And other cars looked different too. I just couldn't understand WHY.

So I went to get my eyes tested at my local optometrist. He tested me for AN HOUR! Looking at different things, reading different lines on the chart and switching eyes and doing it again. He seemed puzzled but intrigued. At the end of the appointment he had results - good news was my vision was perfect. How can there be bad news if my vision was fine? The bad news? Apparently, I wasn't seeing with both eyes!

He sent me to a specialist. The specialist tested my vision for all of five minutes before he had the same result. I wasn't seeing with both eyes. What did this mean? The specialist asked if I had suffered any injuries to my head when I was little - I said no but that I did have an operation on my eye when I was a newborn.

(I was born 16 weeks early, one of my eyes was turned in and I needed an operation to fix it. While it was fixed, the surgeon did too good of a job, he made the muscels in the back of my eye too tight. Or something like that. Thus, my condition.)

The specialist said I have a condition called Monocular Vision. It basically means that I'm not seeing with both eyes - I see with my right eye mostly (the one that got operated on) and then when that eye gets tired, I switch to the left eye without me even knowing I'm doing it.

The specialist asked me some questions: do I have trouble walking down stairs? How was my balance? Did I fall over a lot? Did things LOOK flat?

I thought back to my childhood, yes I did fall down stairs a lot. I always had to hold my mums hand or the railing when going both up and down. When I wanted to put something on the bench, I would miss it a lot.

This is because I have poor depth perception and I can't see in 3D very well. The specialist said that growing up, I would have found ways to deal with my condition without knowing.
I realised that colour was very important to me. I thought it was just because I liked colour but no. Example: if I wanted to put an envelope on the table and the table was blue, I would look at the colours of everything else around the table and say in my head (Okay, the table is blue. Just reach out and drop the envelope when it's touching the blue.) And that's just how I have learnt to deal with it.

By looking at the colours. Judging distance is hard but again, I try and use colours. The red car is bigger than the grey lamp post, when I pass the red car, I'll reach the lamp post.

Sorry I'm not good at explaining it. I knock things over when I'm not paying attention and fall down stairs when I have to look up at something while I'm going down. I look for the lines of each edge of the step.

I didn't know I was seeing the world differently until I got diagnosed. Seeing in 3D must be fun for all of you normal sighted people!It might seem like a small thing as it's only 7$, but really I didn't expect anything, and he offered to buy me a set as he just got a job. I live in a poorer family so usually all the money we have goes to food and bills, and this made me really happy. I've never had anyone online buy me anything, and I don't really have any irl friends as we moved a lot and I couldn't really settle in to our current (and most likely final) home. Really, I just can't describe how happy I feel, and to know there are such nice people out there

Edit: Wow, there are people sending me wishes for my Birthday and some people offered to send me some more strings, I can't believe everyone's so nice 😭Obligatory -- I didn't do this, but I wish I had the means to. My parents were very stern that I was going to university to get a degree that will land me a job with a 6 figure salary... so I did that. I eventually ended up as a software engineer, and I make good money working for a corporation worth billions in the bay area. 

But while I was at university, I wanted to learn so many other things. I wanted to learn about literature and history and the student movements that changed how people see each other. I wanted to do art and study things that I found beautiful about the world. But every time I would dip into those things, it was a big no-no in terms of financial independence unless you stay in academia and teach.

University in a capitalist society is no longer "higher education"; it's just another exchange of money for a service -- in this case, you pay the university to learn about the skill... and then pick up your degree and hope that a company will pay you in exchange for your services. If you choose to veer from that lane, you are expected to struggle, unless you're lucky, of course. 

I'm also not knocking STEM here; thank god that we have people learning math and science and engineering -- I'm also tremendously lucky to be one of them. I also love my job, and it is so fun to build software. I make software as a hobby too; granted it's different than my work. But I wish I could learn about the humanities at university too... that's just me; I want to learn about cultures and people. I wish it were more acceptable to stay at university to do both.

I say all this, but now I'm reclaiming all of that today. I've begun studying nature and my country's history and making art. I'm not as good as I was in college, but with practice and lots of learning, it'll get there.  I wish I could have done this in a university setting, among others doing the same, and nothing beats that experience IMO.I was recently told about a job in my area doing something of which I am quite fond of, and frankly it is sort of a hobby. I was going to go yesterday to apply but something told me to wait, and I did. Today I went in to apply and not only did I grab an application, but I was hired on the spot. I was notified that they didn't even need any extra help, as they had literally hired someone just minutes before my arrival, but because of my attitude and experience he wanted me to start immediately. He said "I need you. I need to hire you right away." These words have meant so much to me, as I have had such a strugglesome year. I have lost my mother, my grandmother is basically lost to dementia, and I have been fighting a drinking problem on top of other things.  I hope this can be my beam of light and I hope it can inspire someone else. My crippling anxiety kept me from looking for a job for the longest time due to working around people, but sometimes obscure jobs are the best. Keep your hopes up for me and anyone else struggling. Please reach out if you feel a struggle because I know I sure as fuck have.

Edit: holy shit this blew up! I've never even really been noticed on reddit and now I have awards?! What?!?! I'll try to respond to as many people as quickly as I can and I thank you all for your congratulations! Its means the world that I have more support from strangers on the internet than I do in real life!

Edit #2: I have no idea what it means or what the significance of the awards mean so if someone could explain, I would be eternally grateful. I never thought I'd get one so I never asked anything about them! Haha

Edit #3: just after completing my first full week I've had to go get a test for corona virus because I've been so sick. I'm sure not many will see this but just as a future warning please, everyone be cautious. My boss doesn't believe in corona so that is great /s but I'm hoping to get through this and come out ok and get back to work. Btw.... I have to give it all up you you who have dealt with this. I don't even know yet if I have it but this shit sucks and I just want to give you all the praise in the world for powering through it. Thank you all for your kind words and support!I think about this all the time.

 I mean we've all seen all this stuff in movies and video games; a virus outbreak, killing thousands, causing unemployment and the rest of it. I go to my local stores to get groceries and everyone is standing 6 feet apart, wearing masks, and disposable gloves. Just like in a movie, every headlines news contains the latest statistics and updates on the virus and how to combat it. Most people have been in their homes for months on end, yet we were kind of instantly accustomed to it. And there's the usual jackasses from the movies as well, denying existence of the virus and roaming about as nothing is afoot.

I don't know, I feel like this is something extremely huge yet most of us probably haven't even thought of it twice. Thank you if you've stuck till the end of my rambling.I’m 27 and have been smoking fairly heavily for 12 years. I’ve never tried to quit before and I’m pretty scared. Earlier this year I switched to vaping for about 6 months (still smoking the occasional cigarette here and there) but it didn’t work out. 

My mom was ecstatic when I gave her my cigs cause she’s been trying to help me get in the quitting mindset for a bit now. She’s an ex-smoker herself, she smoked for 20 years until one day she got fed up and decided she didn’t smoke anymore and never looked back. I hope that same moment is what I’m having now. 

It’s too expensive, I’m tired of having to go outside in the cold to get my fix, always smelling like smoke and having to pop mints before I talk to people. And not for nothing but I’ve successfully quit worse in the past. I’m in recovery and have been clean several years now, I’ve dealt with debilitating withdrawals and gotten through them many times. So this should be cake compared to that, right? I hope. 

I had a dream last night that I went camping in the wilderness with some friends. My senses were heightened, I could smell the dirt and the trees and could hear the wind and animals scurrying for miles...I remember looking up at the stars and they were blue and red and purple, like the night sky was a kaleidoscope. In the dream I kept making remarks to my friends how alive I felt and how I felt so much better away from all the light pollution and city noise. 

If that’s not symbolic I don’t know what is. I think that was my subconscious telling me it’s time to cut this shit out and was probably why I woke up so motivated to quit today. I’m scared, but it’s time.Don’t know if this post fits but early voting was today in my state and as many gen Zers and younger millennials say that voting doesn’t matter or is a waste of time I got all my roommates and their SO’s together to go vote and get lunch together! If anyone is still on the fence about registering and going vote this election let me tell you it was actually pretty fun and made me feel like I was doing some good for my country! I’m a little salty cause they were out of the “I voted” stickers but it was worth it in the end and luckily we went early enough that we were basically in and out! Ik it can feel a little intimidating and overwhelming when signing up and it’s hard in college since you have drive back to where ever your parents live to go vote but luckily we all graduated from the same high school so we made a day out of it! Remember your vote does matter so if you can it’s never too late to make a change!I’m a waitress because I’m in college and it’s the only job that will work with my class schedule and where I can make a living. I’ve worked full time as a waitress since high school and it’s starting to wear on me.

You would think since we are in a pandemic and had to be closed for 4 months that people would be kinder. They are not.

I got screamed at tonight by a customer because I told her that we couldn’t do the substitution she wanted. It is not my rule, it’s the owners. Then they kept making fun of me the whole time they were there. I’m just sick of it... my husband is struggling with severe depression, I’m working 40 hour weeks, going to school full time... I’m barely keeping my head above water. 

Anyways. If you’ve read this far, thank you. Just a friendly reminder to be kind to people. We don’t make up the rules most of the time.

EDIT: I CANNOT believe how kind all of you are. Thank you so much. You have really shown me that there still are good people in this world. I can’t reply to everyone. But I hope each and every one of you have a great day. Thank you for being a good person. I appreciate it.I text him to say I was at the hospital and I would see him later. He immediately phoned back all worried to see what was wrong. 


He forgot he married a nurse.When I was around 8 years old I went to an adventure/theme park based in the UK. While playing in a castle themed wood-chip play area I climbed up one of the towers by ladder into the small room. There were around 10 or 12 of these towers around the play area. When I entered my head into the small room I was met with the sight of a huge shit in the corner covered in flies and a pair of blue socks covered on shit also. Disgusting and weird but yeah, these things happen. 

When I was 15 I moved to another city on the other side of the country and became best friends with a kid on my street. We’re still best friends now 16 years later. 

One day we were talking and the theme park came up to which my friend told me he did a shit in one of the rooms in the castle play area when he was 8 and that he wiped his arse with his socks. I was astonished and asked him particularly which tower and what colour were the socks. He said they were blue and described the same tower. 

So I saw my future best friends shit 7 years before I moved across the country and met him. 

Weird right?I deactivated my Facebook a couple of months ago and recently I deleted my Instagram app too. (I didn’t fully delete the profiles because they have a lot of pictures on them that I’d never be able to recover otherwise.) I have felt so much better now that I’m not mindlessly scrolling through these sites and trying to show off how great my life is. I spend less time locked on my phone and I feel happier and more confident in general. I even pay more attention to my kids. I just think it’s so narcissistic and sad how obsessed people are with these websites. I don’t want to be one of those people. Has anyone else experienced this?We have had a really difficult year as a family. Our kids have been so patient as we have dealt with a lot of serious difficulties. We decided we really needed to take off work and school and stop thinking about everything to spend the weekend all together. They’re not suspecting a thing. I’m so excited for the surprise. I just wanted to tell someone.

Edit to add: we are here now. They started to get suspicious on our way there. They said there’s no way we would really be going to something so boring and speculated about a few other possibilities but they slept on the drive so they didn’t even know what state we were in. We maintained our original story. One thoroughly believed it, the other two remained skeptical. I got them t shirts and Mickey ears and gave them to them to put on, thinking they’d figure it out. But they did not. So we drove into the park and they figured it out then. They have said it’s the best surprise that’s ever happened. I’ll post a video later.Hello I’m turning 25 years old tomorrow (in 2hours) and it’s pretty sad. I tried making plans but it fell through even when I made it 2 days before my birthday. Wish me luck guys I’m going to chill on the couch watching my fave shows.

Dear internet strangers,

I am grateful to all of you taking the time to read my post. I know this site gets a lot of traffic and it means the world to me that you all took time to read my post. 

I just want to say I appreciate and thank you all for your well wishes and starting out my birthday (happy) crying was definitely different compared to my past birthdays.
Thank you for all your advice to enjoy having a day to myself, I haven’t had one of those in a while.
Even sharing your story, sending me a recipe, offering to send me food, offering to play games with me or sending me dms in general makes my heart swell with happiness. 

Also HAPPY BIRTHDAY FELLOW AUGUST BABIES! (Or other bdays that have been missed or coming up) 
I just wanted to share the love to you all! ❤️

You all would be pleased to know my sis made surprise plans for me today and there’s no wallowing in sadness for this human today! 

Once again, from the bottom of my heart, thank you 

P. S. - Thank you for the awards. I truly don’t deserve them.I grew up, not exactly poor, but not exactly middle class either. Put myself through college, been a pretty long road to financial independence. 

Checked my bank account this morning to see 5 digits in my checking account for the first time. I've had that figure in savings a couple times but my poor checking account has always been pretty abused. 

Don't have anybody really irl to tell but I wanted to brag a little :)I arrived in the U.S in April 2019. For the past whole year, I was unable to find a job. Applied, interviewed, failed, repeated. I failed my driver’s license twice. I sucked. I stayed at home almost 24/7 doing nothing but thinking I was a loser. I got depressed and lost 18lbs in 2 months. 2 weeks ago, I had the medical exam which is my last step of getting employed. I’m gonna be working full time for the county. 3 days ago, I passed my driver’s license after failing it the first two times. I finally gained my “freedom”. Yay!!! Everything is getting together just now. I’m excited!

Edit: holy moly booty! I didn’t expect to get that many comments with beautiful and encouraging words from you guys. I am truly thankful for all of those and will try to reply to all. Thanks again for making my day! My happiness is indescribable right now. Thank you!I noticed a post earlier about us being more anti-social with age; which I do completely agree with in my own personal life.  But I think it’s interesting that this is a small thing we COULD look forward to.For anyone unaware, it's an app that allows blind people to ask for assistance on daily tasks. There is a crazy ratio of volunteers to blind people, so I've only gotten 3 calls in the two or so years I've had the app. The first two calls I didn't answer quickly enough and someone else answered first. 
I got my third call today and hesitated to answer because I was having a rough day, but ultimately decided that I rarely get this chance so I should answer. 


I answered the call and the man on the other end immediately said "ma'am, I don't need help. I just wanted to say thank you. You all take time out of your days to help us, so I wanted to take time out of my day to say thank you, and let you know you are appreciated and send love to you and your family during these hard times." 


Cue tears on my end. He heard me crying and I apologized and explained it has been a rough day and how much I appreciate the message. 


What this very kind stranger didn't know was that I had been waiting all day for my brother to have a cranioplasty procedure and had gotten confirmation not twenty minutes earlier that it was complete and he was in post op. I sat at my desk bawling after we hung up. 


There's no clear point to this story, I guess aside from the fact that small gestures can have a much bigger impact on others than you can even imagine.


Edit: I posted this and went to bed shortly after. I am so overwhelmed by the love you're all sending and all of the positivity in this thread. Keep it up, we love to see it!Some of my brain’s favorite dreams:

- Realizing I haven’t attended one of my classes in months and being terrified about failing. 
- The school bus crashes.
- Realizing I haven’t attended one of my classes in months BUT I can’t find or access my schedule anywhere or figure out where the class is. (Can’t log in  online and school administrators are too busy to help.)
- Running through the school trying to find my class and I can’t. Sometimes the school is expansive and it involves travel between campuses. 

Etc. sometimes it’s a variant of all of these. And the weird thing is... yes, high a school was stressful at times, but I enjoyed it. I was in lots of clubs and activities I loved. I got good grades. The most stressful thing to happen was putting off a harder math class until my last semester of senior year and then almost not passing. 

Last night‘s dream, while a stress dream, for the first time had a positive twist haha. So that was nice.

I fell asleep in class and missed my next two. So I tried sitting in on another period’s class and in that class was my celebrity crush. (Matthew Gray Gubler, anyone else?) Cool. Randomly suddenly had a baby to take care of for some reason? 

Then there was a cooking class and while I zoned out and almost didn’t get my crunch wrap finished, a friend helped out and I did. Yay! 

Then on the way home the bus driver was reckless and went up a steep hill and the bus fell over and rolled all the way down the hill. No one was hurt but the bus driver took off and left us all to walk home and the police didn’t care. 

Did high school actually give me PTSD? These dreams happen about once a week and have for the past ten years.For the past few years I’ve had 1-3 sodas a day and as of today I managed to go 1 week without any sodas and I don’t plan on stopping. This has certainly not been easy and cravings have been hitting hard. Also, I’ve been 10 days without sweets (candy, donuts, ice cream etc.) and 17 days with slaty snacks (popcorn, chips, fries, etc.). I’m really proud of myself and want to keep my streak going. 

Any one else trying to get healthier during quarantine? Any advice on how to stay strong when you are seriously craving a soda or salty snack?Sometimes people tell me facts/ tidbits or other random pieces of information and I pretend that I don't know just so that I don't:

1. Instantly shoot them down by saying "oh yeah I knew that"

2. They can enjoy teaching me something 

I feel like it makes their day a little brighter, especially if somebody with common interests to me tells me something.Just something I thought about after I went to the gym. I have so much respect for people who are heavier and go to the gym to change their habits than for people who are already very fit. I mean I still have a lot of respect for fit people but I think it’s way harder to start and make a change and go and workout at a gym with other people looking at you.Yesterday I told my daughter that I'm not her biological father. She's 5 this year, but I've been there since she had just turned 1. I fell in love with my partner but also her, and it's been that way ever since. She seemed excited at the prospect of her choosing me to be her daddy, and stated that now we're 'a big family!'. She has a 2 year old sister too who she adores. I'm the real winner here, for getting the chance to be both of their parents. The reality of the conversation was awful, and I'm sure she didn't really understand, but I'm glad that it's out there now and it can be expanded on as she grows older😃So today I visited my granny with my brother, and because she is disabled I decided to prepare dinner. My granny has bad teeth so she'd like something soft, so after consulting the butcher I decided tenderloin (first time cooking it for me). Because of covid, I prepared everything else in advance. I made a really nice red wine sauce, oven potatoes and fried green beans. When the time came to fry the steak I was sweating like a pig. I had to handle 3 steaks of 13 dollars each, as well as worrying on not to break my granny's brittle teeth on an overdone steak. But as the title says, I freaking nailed it! It was a perfect medium rare, my granny couldn't stop talking about it (whereas she usually loves complaining about everything), and I couldn't be more proud. I just got home and because my roommates are both passionate vegetarians, I decided not to share with them. But here it is, Reddit. I'm not being humble today!Im only just appreciating my own company and how good it is for the mind. Its such a vibe staring at the clear winter night sky covered with blankets with tea in your hands. It feels like the world and its problems are on pause briefly and the only thing that matters is my self :)  
Having that pressure of responsibilities off your back for a few hours is heaven worth being tired the next day for and I recommend everyone to sacrifice time for your selves alone 🖤Hello stranger,

Every day, I pass you on my drive to school. You're always running. When I first saw you a month ago, I was surprised to see you in the August heat. At the risk of sounding insensitive, it was most surprising to see a runner who was overweight.

You're always there, working hard. It's impressive and I respect your get-after-it attitude you clearly have. You've lost a lot of weight.

I myself am an NCAA cross country athlete, and it's always fun to see other runners out there. I love the sport. You don't have to be the fastest to prove yourself. You can run a mile or a marathon and feel proud of your work. You only need an enduring will to gain the respect of every other runner. You clearly have that will. I wish some I had your strength.

Waking up every day, knowing I have another run gets really hard sometimes. It would be too easy just to stop and lose my progress. But when I drive past you, every day, at the same time, you motivate me.

Thank you.

&#x200B;

Edit:  It's so amazing to see everyone cheering others on in the comments. Whatever your goals are, get after them and work hard! We're rooting for you!

To those wondering if I can talk to him at some point, I'll definitely give him a wave and some encouragement and if he passes somewhere I can park someday, he'll get some good words and some water. 

To the few who think it's weird or wrong of me to notice someone working at their goals, I'm sorry you think that. I don't want to be that way. I want to share an encouraging story and help motivate people in their own goals (and they don't just have to be fitness goals). You make a valid point about it maybe being creepy to randomly say hey to the guy; fortunately, we live in an area where that kind of thing is more normal (small town, friendly people).  

Also, thank you for all the awards! I hope this has been motivating for others. This has been really encouraging for me. Stay awesome Reddit!Just had to share.  

Have a dream sitting on the shelf?

Stick with it, even when it gets tough. Take one day at a time and put one foot in front of the other. Small beginnings are STILL beginnings.  We add to it every couple of months but it is currently:

I am smart

I am strong

I am beautiful

I am important

I can do anything 

I am (her name)

She usually gets frustrated when handling small toys that don't fit, like this Barbie toy that has a slide that can be broken into two parts. She pulled it apart and I went to fix it. She said "No, I got it." Then she put it back together. She looked at me and said "I can do anything. Right Daddy?" And it made me so proud.It’s so annoying trying to put the sheets on and it always ends up popping off the corners and it’s such a workout aswell. I hate it so much

Edit: Thanks for the awards <3I just finished a Studio Ghibli's film When Marnie Was There, and at the ending credits there's this OST "Fine on the Outside". The first line really caught my attention - "I never had that many friends growing up". Continuously listening and searching the lyrics on the net, the song just summed up my life. It's my first time hearing this song and it hit me so hard I started to cry. And as I type this, I'm still crying. Never had a song that I really could relate into. It's like my thoughts are reflected and feelings are reflected in this song. And this is what I'm feeling right now. Fine on the outside. 🥺

Edit: didn't expect that this will blow up. 
Anyways, our redditor friend (thank you!), made a playlist on some of the songs that was commented early on. You can check this out:

https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6bVUaAgVbDUgal8UXKiGc4?si=8e6KQWfjSJWVPzlt14lKTASo, about a year ago, my younger brother (16 now) was injured. His friends were playing with a gun, and one of them accidentally shot him. The bullet damaged his spinal cord, and the doctor said there was no chance he’d have feeling from the waist down again. Today, my little brother told me he’s started to regain feeling recently, and he’s now able to move his legs again (not long and not much, it exhausts him). I’ve already gotten all of my crying out, but I don’t really have close friends I wanted to talk to about this, so I wanted to share and chat with my reddit family. Sorry about formatting, I’m on my phone outside of my office.

Edit: I'm hoping to spark some conversations about this as well, maybe if anyone has had a similar situation that they'd like to bring up or any questions regarding the situation. Please feel free to ask away, I'm not too sensitive about the topic.

Edit 2: Wow, this blew up while I was asleep! I’m so thankful for everyone’s good vibes and stories/advice, and I will try to respond to as many people as I can.As a black girl in the US, it's pretty annoying and even a bit depressing to know that your demographic is the least sought after. I'm so used to guys (even the ones who are black) saying that black girls are the ugliest/most undesirable girls and that they wouldn't date them. Hell, I haven't even met a guy who actually *preferred* black girls over all other girls. That's one hell of a rarity. It sure as hell makes me think twice about having crushes, because I always assume he'll be yet another one of those guys. So when I see a guy who actually likes black girls, it gives me a bit of hope. I know most people will find this incredibly stupid, but I like seeing it. 

Note: This isn't to mean that attraction to/preference of girls of other races is a bad thing. I work at an essential plant with 600+ people total across all shifts. Upper management put together goody bags with masks and told us we could voluntarily pick them up and use them and have put alot of great measures into place to help keep us safe. We already had a positive Corona case long ago, so I thought people would jump at this (FREE) opportunity to help protect each other with the bags of masks. Turns out, my friend and I were the only two that picked them up.

You can almost feel the snickering when people walk by and it's giving me flashbacks to being picked on in school for being fat, only it's a mask this time. I've had people tell me how idiotic it is because it's "too late in the game" and how pointless it is. I'm baffled, slightly embarrassed, but maintaining wearing it at all times while I'm here because I'm trying to do my part. Has anybody else experienced this? I feel alone in this and it sucks.

Thanks for letting me vent.

Edit: Thank you so much for all the support and kind messages. It means so very much! 🙂She found me on Instagram and sent me a heartfelt apology. She called me a beautiful person who was fun to hang around and told me she regretted not being able to see that before. It was kind, and mature, and I really appreciated it. When I was younger I felt humiliated by the bullying and dreamed of revenge. Getting that message helped me realize why forgiveness is so much better, even if it takes a lot of time. Revenge just creates more pain. Reconciliation allows everyone to heal and grow. I responded letting her know how I felt and that all was forgiven.

Edit 1: Thank you so much for the awards! Also, thank you to everyone liking, commenting and discussing. I’m glad that this has brightened so many people’s days a little bit.

Edit 2: Wow, Platinum!!!!!! Thank you so much kind stranger! Also, this exploded over night, thank you everyone! I’ll keep reading and responding to comments as I can. 

It’s beautiful how both old bullies and the bullied are resonating with this and opening up about their experiences. For everyone bullied, I hope you escape/have escaped that situation and have the space and support you need to heal. For bullies, it is never too late to stop bullying and start to change, even if it feels too late to reconcile with your victims. We all have the capacity for light and darkness. Thank you to everyone choosing light.I no longer come under the 'obese' category. I'm offically overweight now! I never thought this day would come! Just 10 more kgs to go!!! I went from 95 kgs(208lbs) to 80 kgs(176lbs) at 5'5", my goal weight is 70(154lbs) and under. Final 10 kgs(22lbs) and I'll be in the normal bmi range. It feels so fking unreal!

Added the measurements in pounds.
To everybody asking how I did it, it was mostly fasting and OMAD. You can check out my profile for more(or pictures of the progress)
Wow, this is a real wholesome community. Thank you, people.It might not be much to some people but I had no hope 2 years ago, I was ashamed to go to my daughters school events because I felt like the poor dad. This new job just feels like validation.  So about 3ish years ago (Sept 2016) I bought a pineapple and after cutting it up, instead of throwing out the top I thought it'd be a good idea to plant it and attempt to grow my own pineapple. For 2.5 years it grew very well but didn't flower, and I nearly called it after reading not every pineapple plant will flower. But then one day i was out in the garden and peeked into the top of the plant to see a little pinecone looking flower, and since then i've been checking it every day waiting to pick it and eat it. Anyway today I picked it, exactly 1,273 days since i planted it and i cannot wait to share it with the family for dessert tonight. 

Here it is: https://i.imgur.com/7I2Rkq8.jpg

EDIT: DAMN! Grabbed coffee with some friends and came back to 2.9k updoots! I'm feeling the love 😍🥰

EDIT: Woke up to 10k updoots, this is nuts! I had no idea people would be interested in my pineapple. This is so wholesome <3I was helping my mother with a stack of mail/bills that piled up on the counter. I found a credit card statement that showed they still owed over $4k and they were only paying the minimum as it was what they could afford. It would take them roughly 18 years to pay off the whole thing. Knowing they are of retirement age and living on a fixed income, I wanted to help them out and so I paid the remaining balance on their card to clear their debt. When I told my mom what I did, she looked at me in disbelief and looked like she was going to break down in tears. I found out that that debt was from my parents borrowing money to pay for me and my brother’s college...I felt that it was only right to pay off their debt now that I have a decent and stable job. 

My parents have always and continue to support me...I just want to be able to do the same for them. I could never repay them for all the love and sacrifices they have made to help me and my brother get to where we are today, but I just want to be able to help them in any way that I can.

Edit: Wow! Heartfelt thanks for all the kind words and awards! I also enjoyed reading some of your similar stories as well. I was just looking for a place to share a wholesome moment!This is really silly I know but it made me really happy. I love this supervisor he’s got a kid my age and has a real dad vibe.  One time we were both talking with a customer and he grabbed my shoulder( it was for a reason but I can’t remember now) and I flinched hard.

After the customer left he apologized and asked if I was okay.  I don’t like being touched and usually when people learn I don’t like being touched suddenly, they seem to go out of their way to touch me. Because for some reason it’s funny to see me flinch.

My supervisor is a very touchy person but after he learned I didn’t like being touched he was very careful to respect my personal space. On my last day of work though he looked me dead in the eye and asked if it was okay to hug me. 

I’ve rarely been asked if I wanted to be hugged and it was so nice and wholesome. I actually love hugs, I just don’t like being touched without being asked. I’m gonna miss this supervisor.

Like I said it’s so small but it means so much that somebody actually took my discomfort into account and was so nice and respectful


Edit: So people are calling me sexist because I specified my supervisor was a man. I didn’t mention that I’m a girl so it seems like a lot of people made assumptions. I am a girl but even if I were a dude I still wouldn’t want people to touch me.

I didn’t intend for this to be sexists. I don’t  like men or women touching me. This male supervisor actually talked to some of my female associates about boundaries, because they thought just because we were all girls they could be in my space all they want.  It was meant more as a descriptor. So I’m sorry if I offended anybody. 

This was suppose to be a casual conversation, please stop the hate and death threat messages

EDIT 2: Wow, thank you everybody for your kind words. It’s really the small acts of kindness and consideration that stick with you.About three days ago my dad was in a really bad accident and  had to get his arm amputated. 

My dad’s a musician, has been one all his life, he called me just now at the hospital and we were just talking, at one point he began lamenting about how he’ll never be able to play an instrument ever again and began crying and it’s the first time I’ve ever heard him cry before.

Just a week ago he bought this electric drum set and was really excited about it, I even helped him put it together. Now he can’t use it anymore.

In my 17 years of life I’ve never heard my dad this sad or distraught. Things are really shitty right now.I work in retail, a good chunk of my customers are regulars who I see on a daily basis. One of these regulars is a father who always comes in with his little girl. The girl is so kind and sweet and joyful, she's always bouncing around and greeting everyone and is honestly such a beacon of light

Today was her birthday, and she came in on a pair of roller skates. She had only had them for a few hours, but she was already a pro and was skating like it was nothing.

I'm a very sad and depressed person. I'm not great at customer service because talking to people drains my energy. But this little girl is honestly the highlight of my workday everytime she comes in, and I wanted to do something nice for her since it was her birthday. So I asked her father if it would be ok for me to give her a chocolate bar, and he said I could. It was a really minor gift for such an amazing child, so I didn't expect much of a reaction.

But when I handed it to her, she screamed, spun around in circles, and then hugged me. And I honestly had to hold back tears.

I'm 22, and I've always felt awkward around kids. I've always felt self conscious about them thinking I'm boring, and I get jealous of other people who know how to make kids laugh and smile. But I feel like today showed me that I can make kids smile, and that I can maybe make a difference in their day. And as someone who had a rough childhood, idk. The possibility of that kinda makes me cry lol

Edit: thank you all for the kind words. I'm sorry I haven't responded to everyone, just kinda overwhelmed. 

A few commenters have asked questions about Covid, and I'll say that I do live in America and I know that the hug shouldn't have really happened. But it was an impulsive, spur of the of the moment type of thing where she just jumped on me. She was wearing a heavy coat and mittens, and we were both wearing face masks that covered our noses. Also, she was so tiny that she barely reached my knees, and I did not touch her or put my arms around her and there was no skin-to-skin contact. Afterwards, her father reminded her that we have to stay 6ft apart from each other, and then he thanked me. 

Again, thank you all so much.I was just upvoting another comment and it came up with "up up and away". Curious, I hit another upvote and it said: "You have a strange and orange heart"

LOL

Doesn't appear to work on downvotes, you assholes lol

Edit: Doesn't seem to work on all comments, but it's been fun finding the ones that it does.

Edit II:  We have u/itsthesnake to thank for the quote list! Also, a moderator explained that you have to be on old reddit and have "allow subreddit themes" in settings for this to work. It does not work on new reddit because new reddit doesn't have CSS, and it does not work on mobile.  Also, there are other subs that have this fun little quirk. A few that have been mentioned is: Marvel, Game of Thrones and I don't remember the others lolWe chatted just before he went away and decided it would be fun if I took up the mammoth task of sending a daily update. All of his (willing) friends have chipped in now and then, but now I'm struggling for what to send him outside major news.  
He has no idea how much I've expended the emails since I originally sent them, but think he'll get a kick out of this. Any random personal news or really obscure actual news would be appreciated  
  
Edit: Wow! This blew up a lot more than I was expecting. Thank you all for your news. I'm sure he'll appreciate it all once he finally resurfaces, and I'll post an update as well. No timeframe for when that will be though!Except, the German word for raccoon is "waschbär," which means "wash bear." So the Germans actually might be the appropriate level of impressed.Title says all. My roomie of 11 months who owes me over 500 dollars threw a glass of milk at my face and kicked me in the stomach. I called the police and they mediated a solution where she signed an agreement to pay me back in full (enforceable through small claims) and then I went to Thailand to see my girl.

She was a German exchange student (I live in LA) and we hit it off immediately. We’ve been separated for months and when we finally met up again she didn’t feel the same and dumped me. But like...I feel amazing.

I feel like I’ve finally cut the fat out of my life. My small business is picking up, my acting career is going amazing (adidas commercial, and over 200 mil views on vids I’ve been in in the last year) and I’m here in Thailand eating my favorite food. I thought I’d be dying about now, but I moved on and am just super happy and grateful for how my life has worked out and I am just so ready to see my friends and get this business making a LOT of money (after I eat all the food I can ram into my belly obvi)

TLDR my life kinda fell apart but i feel better than ever

Edit: I wanted to say thank you to everyone who replied. I never got to talk about this the way I have in the last few hours and its been really helpful to work through it all properly. I really appreciate you all!It’s early Easter afternoon and my wife is drunk. I’ve never seen her this drunk. She rarely drinks, but this morning we had a couple mimosas for breakfast. Well, I had two and she had four. She’s in the other room rambling in a drunken stupor. But that rambling is why I’m posting. She won’t stop talking about how great I am. I’m the nicest. I’m the most laid back. I always let her be her. I’m funny. I’m nice to look at. I’m so smart. 

I don’t think any of that but I’m so glad that in her super annoying drunken stupor she thinks so highly of me:) I guess I’m doing ok.

Edit: Oh shit. She’s feeling nauseous. Sprite has been poured and she’s been instructed to walk around a bit. This day might go from cute and motivating to shit:)

Edit2: She’s screaming along to Oasis now. The dogs are barking and she’s upset that they don’t like her singing. I reassured her that she has a beautiful voice. Apparently drunks don’t sense lies.

Edit3: I have informed her that she is NOT a bad person for getting drunk on Easter. She’s sad now:(

Edit4: She just reached for my Wild Turkey 101. She’s been cut completely and forevermore.

Edit5: I’ve tested her and she’s still reaching for my Wild Turkey. Therefore she’s failed, however I think she’s progressing. She’s narrating a movie and doing a good job:) We’re progressing from parent to partner!

Edit6: I’ve been out and about and holy shit. My phone has not stopped buzzing. I’m going to do my best to reply. 

Thank you all for the kind words. She’s now got a waking hangover, which are never fun, but I’ve read a ton of comments to her and she’s pleased:)I don't have many people to talk to and even fewer who actually care. But I just got a full time job paying a salary of $42k at age 20 and I don't have a college degree.

I've been working for my state lottery for about a year and a half now but only part time. I've been applying for every full time position available for the past 3 months and a month ago I had an interview for this job. I royally fucked up the interview (at least I thought) and they picked someone else. Then I was visiting my best friend out of state last week and out of nowhere they called me saying the person who they had chosen could no longer move forward with it so they were conducting 2nd interviews over video calls and asked if I wanted to interview again the very next day. The lady also gave me tips on where to find things I should know for the interview on the inner works of the business. After running to a retail store and picking up a dress shirt and tie I starting researching the rest of the day. After that long story short I did extremely well in the interview and then ended up choosing me for it.

My first day is tomorrow and I'm excited, scared, worried, happy, confident and timid all at once every 5 seconds.

Edit: thank you all so much for the feedback, support, and advice. It really means a lot to me. And I wasn't expecting any awards but thank you for making this my first post to get awarded. 

I greatly appreciate the advice and will take everything into consideration. 

And for all the people asking for tips. Everything that got me to where I am has been my work ethic, research for resources, and willingness to help. I found my states government jobs website and applied for whatever I was qualified for and only got one interview, then I used my good relationships with Co workers and bosses to give good recommendations and then just doing my best in hopes of moving up in the company and it worked.

Don't worry about not having the best paying job by a certain age. Just do your best and don't rush and good things will come to you.Is it normal for people to be able to walk up to any stranger and strike up a conversation? I wish I could do that. I´m 33M, and I´m shy. I dream of becoming more extroverted. I´m already training to conquer a marathon in August, and I figure conquering my social anxiety is another high priority on my list. I want to make more friends and find a girlfriend. My social circle post covid has really gotten small, with so many of my old friends either moving far away, getting busy with children or cutting ties with me. And so I went out tonight, with the goal of having just one social interaction. I ended up having 10!!! Here are the results:

1: Asked two women for a movie recommendation. They said: "Long Shot with Seth Rogen".  
2: Asked two men for a movie recommendation. They said: "Into the wild".  
3: Asked a man and a woman for a movie recommendation. They didn´t have any ideas, but we had a short convo about climate change and where they were from (Italy and South America).  
4: Asked two men what rapper they were listening to on their speaker. Capital Steez (Young deceased rapper from NY).  
5: Asked guy what rapper he was listening to on his speaker. Looniz (90's hip hop).  
6: Asked group what the rules are about amplified music after cops started roaming the area and ordering people to turn off their music.  
7: Yelled WOAH I SURRENDER at guy who was biking around with a big blinding light and yelling POLICE.  
8: Talked to guy who got harassed by the cops.  
9: Asked two guys what football club they were so enthusiastic about (Brøndby).  
10: Said congratulations to a guy wearing a high school graduation hat. He shook my hand and I wished him good luck in life.

At some point, I hope I can find the courage to do introductions that can lead to more open ended and longer conversation, like: *"Hey, my name is \_\_\_, I'm out meeting new people tonight. How's it going?"*

How is your own social life?

\*EDIT: Y'all are blowing my mind! The kindness here is overwhelming. I hope you all dare to reach for your dreams! I´ll definitely challenge myself to go out a lot more, and I´ll take some of all this good advice I´ve received. I'll post back here with the results. I'll try get to all your comments. If there's something I can do for any of you, just ask! Thanks a million!  


\*2ND EDIT:  


I went out alone again last friday night. Here are the results:  


1. Asked man for movie recommendation. Shutter Island. The Tenant.  

2. 2 men and 2 women. Movie recommendation. The Untouchables.  

3. 1 man. Talked to him about running since he was wearing running gear. His name was Michael. We exchanged numbers and agreed to run together some time this week.  

4. 2 men bare chested and draped in flags. I told them they looked like super heroes. Asked them what their super hero name and power would be. One of them said that his power is to score all the ladies. And that his super hero name is DAMN MAN. I thought that was hilarious!  

5. 2 guys 1 woman movie rec. Memento (again, second group recommending that old movie in one evening, woah). The Blind Side. The Number 42.   

6. 2 guys. Asked what neighbourhood is the best place to live in this city. They said "Bryggen". Good but expensive. Which is right where we were, and where I live right now. So lucky me.  

7. 2 women. Movie rec. Said I needed a love movie. Lol. They said "After".  

8. 1 man 1 woman movie rec. They said "We don't live here" and walked away. What the hey did that have to do with my question? Lol.  

9. 1 man 1 women. Told them I'm practicing meeting new people. Asked them what they hope to experience this summer. Which turned out to be an awesome opener, as they were really open about this, and they even started asking me questions. I told them about my marathon plans and the music I am working on. So they just moved here. 1st summer in this neighbourhood. They wanted to experience summer and friends. And her mom's cowboy themed 50th birthday party. All before starting their masters degrees in the fall. I wished them good luck with that, and we exchanged polite banter before parting ways. Awesome.  

10. 1 man 1 woman. Similar interaction to number 9. Same opener. *"Hi, I'm practicing meeting new people tonight. Can I ask you one question? What do you hope to experience this summer?"* Seriously, this opener is awesome, people respond so positively. Anyway, a long talk. We ended up talking about the Amarmino, which is a local hiking route that I ran recently as part of marathon training, and that they hiked recently too. They wanted to travel to Barcelona and Norway. And try out some hostels or some couch surfing. We had an awesome talk.  


I feel like I could have asked the last two couples if they wanted to go out together some time.   


BONUS INTERACTIONS on other recent days than aforementioned friday:  


11. I was stretching after a run, when I noticed a woman with airpods. Asked her what she was listening to. A podcast about soccer.  


12. Saw guys listening to insane death metal while I was out running. Said "what the hell is that?! It sounds awesome!" They said it was Deicide, and that it was straight from hell. They recommended it as running music, lol.  


13. Similar to 11, but I saw her during a run. She was listening to Ibiza with Cardi B.  


It's thanks to everyone here that I am so inspired to keep going out and reaching out. You can do it too! I will probably make a new post with this update as well. Stay tuned for more if you like! Thanks!  


  
I finally feel like I'm not just standing in place and everyone else is zooming past me. Now we're all forced to stay inside and slow down the momentum. Welcome to my world brethren.
(Setting is Dubai at around 5:30pm) I don’t know if this will reach you but I hope you have reddit and happen to stumble upon this post cuz it’s been eating me up all day.

I was the girl sitting on the stairs with an energy drink in my hand. I read something funny on my phone and laughed while looking up and this is where we locked eyes (the sky was really pretty so you were taking a photo of it which I do all the time there’s nothing odd or funny about it) but the whole thing looked like I was mocking you and I should’ve said something but I just froze and I didn’t think much of it until an hour later. I’ve been feeling guilty about it all day so if you read this, know I wasn’t making fun of you it’s the timing of me reading a funny joke and us locking eyes that made it seem as if that’s what happened. Please continue taking pictures of the sky and have a great day.She's very professional and relatively serious, so some things sound especially silly coming from her mouth.

This is especially effective when she's ordering food, as her hunger gives her tunnel vision.

Today, I managed to get her to say "awesome blossom onions" 13x in one conversation, with a straight face.

Edit1: I've literally never been defended this much on Reddit before.

Edit2: I cannot believe that something this simple evoked such an array of responses. Thank you for the awards and for sharing your own experiences as well!We just moved to a new house and were very excited about the wood stove that came with it. Our inspector had written that there was no carbon monoxide detector in the report he gave us and recommended we buy one. We lit a fire without one anyway. I assumed it was unlikely that carbon monoxide would be an issue mostly because I was uneducated on how it is created. The fire was cozy and my husband fell asleep on the couch. I was tempted to do the same, but decided to move to the bedroom. My husband snores very loud so sometimes I just leave him on the couch. Last night, however, I decided to wake him up before I went to bed. Around 3:30 am I awoke to a loud beeping and the words CARBON MONOXIDE coming from what we thought was a smoke detector right outside of our room. We jumped out of bed and opened all of the windows and doors before heading outside. Our bedroom is at the very back of the house, far away from the fireplace. Today I am grateful that we decided not to sleep on the couch last night, and that we do in fact have a carbon monoxide detector. As sappy as it is, I am just grateful that I got to wake up this morning. We bought two more detectors this afternoon.When you’re getting a wristband put on, always put out your wrist with the palm of your hand facing up. That way it won’t stick to your arm hair.

If the adhesive part of the wristband doesn’t align and sticks to you, fold it over.

To take off a wristband, grab the loose part on the interior and pull it in the opposite direction it’s facing, towards the adhesive.

When putting a wristband on a small child, make sure you ask them if it’s too loose/tight. 

As for dealing with a child’s wrist size, you can either wrap the band around the wrist until it fits, or you can make a “whale’s tail” with the band (stick the adhesive strip to the underside of the band so that it fits the wrist and the rest of it will stick straight up). You can either cut off the excess or let it stay depending on the child’s preference.

If you know you will be wristbanding a lot of children, it can be helpful to cut some short in advance so that they’re sized appropriately.

If someone obviously wants to put a wristband on you, don’t try to take it and do it yourself unless you’re confident you can do it. You probably can’t. It’s hard to do one-handed.

When you have a lot of practice wristbanding, you will be able to do it very, very fast. Use the time you save with the application of the band to make sure the adhesive is lined up.

Brace the band against the wrist with your middle fingers while you line up the adhesive with your thumbs and index fingers. 

And finally, every single person makes the joke that it’s like going to the hospital/to the club. You’re not funny or original for that one. Sorry.I'm sorry. Its probably not my place to say as a Brit. But how on earth can you have a national election when each state has its own rules on when it can start counting votes and for how long after the poll closes it'll still accept mail in balots.

This isn't to question the legitimacy of the election. And each vote **MOST DEFINITELY** should be counted. 

But the variance in rules will always give rise to disagreement and reasons for objection. 

Or am I missing something?

Edit: wasn't expecting such a big reaction. But I obviously understand that this is very much at the forefront of pretty much everyone's minds. Some really interesting comments here and I've learnt quite a bit. Thank you.

Edit2: Thank you for the Silver! First one ever lol. Very kind :)

Edit3: Gold! Wow. Thank you and thank you for the other badges too! :))Hey there, not to be dramatic but I accidentally deleted my entire Tumblr account about 30 minutes ago and I’m just sitting here thinking about how stupid I am. I was just trying to clean up my account and delete a few side blogs that I wasn’t using and I rushed through and somehow deleted my main blog which deletes everything. I’ve emailed Tumblr, but from everything I’ve read I think everything is just gone. All of my posts, all of the people I was following... I made friends on there and I don’t remember a lot of their usernames, so if it’s truly just gone, I feel so lost. I signed up around 2009/2010, and have used it off and on since then. I was somewhat active in the writing community and it was just a place to express anything I wanted. I signed up again just to save my URL but seeing it so blank with nothing... I’m just devastated. Over 40k posts... gone. I’m wondering if anyone else has made such a dumb mistake like I have.

Edit: thanks for the awards I guess. I'm 19 and own a PS3. Never been an avid gamer -I'm more into movies and stuff- but since I was a child I've always bought the latest PlayStation. I had 1, 2, 3 & 4 through the last two decades. I'm interested in the so-called “essentials”. I played through most of the GTA's, either borrowed or owned. ~~I'm a GTA III truther as well.~~ I played the hell out of GTA V around 2015.

A month ago or so I decided to re-play that game with a more healthier approach to its artistic merits, game design, script, instead of just skip cinematic and doing the missions just for fun.

Here’s where my grandmother comes in. Her name is Delia and was born in **1937**. She doesn't live in the house, she just visits a lot, travels by bus. She's a classic grandma, she knits, walks slow, reminisces from time to time. I've been very close to her always, she taught me how to cook, and I always show her films I think she'll like and she's down for it. My mother sleeps through any movie I show her, but grandma watches everything as long as it isn't too crazy. For instance, she wouldn’t get Ghostbusters, but she has seen and loved Grapes of Wrath or The Pianist, or The Wild Bunch, or any other movie that is not too fantasy-ish, and is more into classic drama. She has somehow seen probably 10 times more movies than most people her age because of me, yet she’s still simple and humble enough to forget about them.

She has seen Breaking Bad and The Sopranos with me. At first I would watch them alone, but she's in the house a lot so eventually she would get hooked, and asked me to see the next episode to see what happened. I mostly indulge her because she's old and these are her last 10-20 years of life **(she's enjoys an astonishingly great physical condition)** and I believe she's happy, enjoying art, which I'm glad to be a part of. If I asked her now, she probably wouldn't recall a lot of specifics about those shows, she just lives in the moment and goes “that was fun!”. Very cheerful attitude.

My point is she's not that complex, she doesn't know names of actors or directors, maybe Tom Hanks but not much else etc., she just likes to watch amusing stuff. I'd never showed her video games because even my mother is too old for that shit so I just assumed she wouldn't understand them at all. I don't think she fully does either still. But when I was starting off GTA V at around the Franklin-meets-Michael point she just sat in the sofa, thinking it was like an animated movie in one of the cutscenes. And she got hooked.

She has actually seen me assault a building with a plane, ride the desert in a four-engine to burn down a house, kidnap a guy in the trunk of a car, etc. She's not totally hardcore, she couldn't stay during the Trevor torture scenes because it was “too gruesome”, and those sort of things I understand. But other than that, she knows all of the characters by fucking name. From Franklin and Lamar to Chop, even Lazlow. She loves Michael. I think that's why she got hooked, she just gets entertainment out of his broken family situation and the tragic nature of his life, and she laughs at whatever stupid catchphrase Trevor says as well.

She would always say “let's watch that show you like”, referring to GTA. Like, she knows it's a video game that I am controlling, as I have explained to her many times, but I don't think she cares and just calls it “show”. It's hilarious and dramatic fundamentally as a story, and has good characters, which I ultimately take as a victory lap for the game, because it still proves that after years of its toxic online culture and exploitation by YouTubers, it's still, at its core, a great, vivid, well told story that anyone above a certain age can enjoy. And these past couple of weeks have been bizarre. *I never thought I would play that game and get not only the enjoyment of such a gratifying play, but also the constant active reaction of my grandmother to most of it.*

I’ve played alone to do some side-missions and stuff. But I made sure to wait for her to be around the house for me to play some of the best missions, and the ending as well. I’ve finished it, or should I say we’ve finished it, and when it ended she was happy she saw how it turned out (I picked the third risk option to make it more of a happy ending). Since then, it’s been all back to normal, watching movies from time to time. It must be more common than what I think it is to see older people invested in this kind of stuff, but I thought I would write it down somewhere and share with you this lazy, fun ride that I had with an 83 year-old woman playing a household video game. It’s just amazing to me.

**TL;DR: My grandma got hooked on the storyline of GTA V when I started playing and saw me playing it all the way through for a couple of weeks.**You. Yes, you. I am writing this for you.

I know you are reading this. And I want you to know I am writing this for you. No one else will understand. No one else knows. They think that this if for them. But it's not. I am writing this for you.

I want you to know, life... it's hard. Every day can be a challenge. It can be a challenge to get up in the morning. To get yourself out of bed. To put on that smile. But I want you to know, that smile is what keeps others going some days. You need to remember, even through the tough times, you are amazing. You really are.

You should be happy. You are beautiful. 

I know that the weather might not be perfect. You might have to turn your back to the wind or feel the cold nipping at your nose. But you know what, at least you are there to feel it. At least you can enjoy the sun's warm rays on your face. Or that cold February wind biting at your cheeks. You know what that means?

&#x200B;

**You are alive.**

Everything will be okay.I have spent the last 2 weeks in sweat pants, barely having left the house, messy disheveled hair and beard and just feeling all around blah. 

Today I had to go grocery shopping so I decided to put on a pair of nice pants and a collered shirt, styled my hair and trimmed by beard. Just to go grocery shopping, just to have a few moments of normalicy amongst the craziness. 

Sometimes it is the smallest of things that can have the biggest impact on our mental health. 

Stay safe friends

Edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger, It is my first one ever!Because of this whole coronavirus, I usually stay on my computer until 3AM or even 4M, and because of that, I wake up either 12:30PM or 1PM. I realized that my sleep scheduled was f\*\*\*d up, so I decided to pull an all-nighter, stay up all day, and sleep at night at the proper time.

I think I ever pulled an all-nighter only once before, and it was an accident (spent all night playing Heavy Rain and didn't notice the time passing), but now purposely trying to stay awake all night, feels weird. I went to the bathroom and saw the sun slowly rising, and the atmosphere felt so... different. It was dark, but there were some beams of light appearing. I spent the next 40 minutes literally just staring at the sky, watching it slowly become clearer and brighter.

I won't lie, it was beautiful, but weird. I rarely wake up early, and it was a whole different experience for me. I know this seems like a meaningless and rather childish post to share, but I just wanted to share my thoughts. Besides, there's literally nothing else to do, and I wanted to kill some time, and decided to share this, so this subreddit actually helps me with this all-nighter, too!

I know nobody cares, but it's currently 7:30AM as I finish typing this. It's gonna be a loooooooong day today, people...

**UPDATE:** Bad news, my friends... when my Mom woke up at 10:00AM, she urged me to at least take a hour-long nap, and she literally grabbed me by the arm, pulled me outta my chair and placed me on my bed. As soon as my head touched my pillow... bruh... it was like a bolt of lightning. I just remembered waking up two and a half hours later!

I'm still exhausted as hell, but it doesn't matter. I failed staying up until night again... LOLLike the title says, hit 5 years sober back on August 23rd, and became a trainer at the beginning of August for my company. My wife said that I did a god job at becoming a trainer, but doesn’t seem interested in the next step in my career. 

Since becoming a trucker, I’ve lost contact with the few friends I did have, and now I just drive and go home. Becoming a trainer in my company is kind of a big deal as they don’t let anybody become one. Have to get a few recommendations beforehand. 

As far as 5 years sober, does it really matter if nobody cares if I’m a drunk or not anymore? It does to me, and it’s one of the very few things I’m proud of in my life.

Sorry if this went on too long, just random thoughts today. Thanks to anyone that takes the time to read this. I do appreciate it.

Edit: I am happily surprised that this getting the attention that it is. Thank you to all for your kind words. It truly does mean a lot. On a side note, 3 awards and one is a gold?!? Thank you!!!

Edit 2: Holy crap! This thing blew up! Thank you everyone for all the awards. It kinda blows me away that so many of you care so much about a trucker who is just trying to do the right thing. I tried to keep up with the comments, but this thing took off. I will try to respond as much as I can today. Again, I thank each and every one of you that took the time to read my post. This means so incredibly much. Words cannot really express it.I grew up in Curicó, Chile, was born in 1984, so 90's and 2000's was home always, and I was a big fan of USA Tv, like a big fan. I was bullied as a kid, so my weekend was watch cable TV, that was everything I did. I loved America and American Tv. So much. 

In 2009 I managed to pay myself a vacation to NYC, and of course, being a massive fan, I got tickets to the Daily Show. This was the week before Valentine's, Feb 2009, a show with a Samantha Bee about robots. 

I showed up in Lower East Manhattan near the river at 1PM, when they called us around 4. So I managed to get front row. 

When Jon showed up, he started talking to the crow, and when he wanted somebody from the audience to say something, I, a really shy foreign guy, stood up and said I saw him on the Sony TV station. That's a real channel here in South America. Very popular by the way. 

He told me I should read the name of the channel in the screen and not below the screen. 

Everybody laugh. I loved it. Really, really, really clever joke. 

Greatest moment ever.20F. Adults around me are always amused by how well I get along with children, no matter how shy the kid is. I become the baby sitter at all family events and even the wildest of children sit quietly around me and listen to me. That's cause I LISTEN. I treat children like actual people and the other adults think it's whore magic.

Yesterday my six year old cousin made his dad call me to explain what chocolate he wanted. Uncle said that my cousin has been blabbering about this chocolate for hours, and even made a drawing of it, but nobody could understand. Then he handed the phone over to him. Poor baby gave me all the hints and I understood within seconds. I literally explained the same shit to my uncle, that my cousin told me, word by word. Yet somehow, he understood me while he could not understand his own child. Then my cousin went "See! I knew she understands!" in the background. I was happy ngl. To have a child value me so much. Made my day. Still ticked me a little.

People don't even listen to their kids and then have the nerve to say that kids are little demons. Treat kids with respect and you'll receive respect. It's THAT easy.



EDIT: This post wasn't meant to be an attack on parents. I do realise how exhausting it must be. We used to be a joint family and the children were my responsibility for most of the day, except for their bed time or other needs. It is extremely exhausting because by evening I did not have the energy to study, and I was 15-16. I have a lot of respect for full time parents who have to work AND manage kids. 

I just wanted to encourage EVERYONE to treat kids with more respect. At least for the children that I have met, I can say that they love it when people actively engage with them, instead of shutting them up because they're children. 

Also, didn't know this would blow up. Thank you for the awards!Just found out and I am so happy right now!!


Obligatory edit: Jesus, front page really? I've been a redditor for a few years now and I gotta say I'm overwhelmed by your support (except for that one guy who said he wanted to have sex with my unborn child but hey, internet am I right?). Anyway thanks for the love and I'll make sure in 8/9 months to show my baby off to you guys!I am a divorced mom of 17 and 14 year old boys. So, of course, I work full time, but these boys are my life.

My boys love me, but they want me not around too much. You know how it is at those ages. They're always asking "When do you have to travel overnight for work again? Or go see your sister?" Etc. And when I'm home, you know, they make themselves scarce. I get it. But it's sad for me, too, even though I was most certainly the exact same way as a teen.

Today I had an appointment in the morning and another in the afternoon so I just took the whole day off (a rare thing tbh). I got lunch at a place I don't get to go very often and curled up with a good book I haven't had time to read. 

When my 17 year old got home from school, he came up to my room sat on the edge of my bed, where I was reading, and actually told me about his day!! He kind of had a rough one. So we talked through some of the things that went on and he actually listened and heard me. Then he said,"Mom, you look like you're really enjoying your day off and I'm happy for you. I'm glad you were here to talk to when I got home."

When my 14 year old was about due to get off the bus, I leashed up the dog and walked to the bus stop. Honestly was worried that he'd rip me with "OMG I can't believe you met me at the bus like a kindergartner!! You totally embarrassed me!" But no! He just strolled towards us, let the dog jump on him and lick his face, and I even caught him glancing back towards the bus to to see if any of his buds saw. But it wasn't in embarrassment. It was more like "Look! My dog and mom are awesome!" Then.... he HUGGED ME. Right there on the sidewalk!! We walked home and he said "Mom, I am glad you were home today and it was really cool that you brought Pokey to meet me at the bus stop."

Ooooh..... all this just makes my heart BURST with unspeakable joy!! But honestly, makes me sad, too, because, while I love my career and I think I need to do it for my own mental health, I will never be, and never was, a stay at home mom. I'm single. If I don't work, we don't eat. Period. 

So I had to share what my boys said and for teens or parents out there, see yourself in this post! Even if you don't hear the words from your teen, or say the words to your parents, it's still there deep down. I had one day like this at least. Tomorrow they'll be asking again if I have any overnight trips coming up soon or turning their back and slamming the door on me. And it's OK.

&#x200B;As I was driving to Walmart to get my grocery pickup, I ended up taking a wrong turn (in auto pilot lol)  and had to double back on a neighborhood street. And as I drove by, I saw, yknow, a few people out for walks on their own, all separated by many yards, but one thing made me almost stop and ask for a picture. 

Two boys were lying on the sidewalk facing each other with their Nintendo Switch's out, 6 feet apart but still together. They looked at me and grinned at their genius as I drove past, and I laughed and felt happy for a good while after that.Maybe it’s because I’m getting older and the “magic” of Christmas isn’t there for me anymore but I’m finding myself not as excited for Christmas this year versus years past which I hate. Anyone else feeling the same way?Transformation is important and I am proud of every single one of you, no matter how insignificant it may seem. Life is a lesson and you are the independent variable.Disclaimer: I am not sharing this story in an effort to put myself over, puff myself up or say “Look what I did!” like so many do when they do something charitable these days. I’m only sharing this story to brag about these three kids who I will probably never see again and to encourage others to be the change that they want to see in this world. 

I was driving to my younger brother’s house a few days ago and had to make a quick stop to get some food at a drive thru. As I was driving, I saw three little boys, ages ranging from probably 6-11 years, standing on a street corner holding poster board signs. As I got closer to the stop sign, I noticed that they had a cooler and several cases of bottled water next to them. Their signs read:

“Selling 
Bottled Water $1 
Soda .75

Saving for mom’s birthday present”

This hit me like a ton of bricks. A little bit about me: I am a recently divorced, single dad who had to fight his ex wife for every other weekend and Tuesdays overnight with my 8 year old and 2 year old sons. My kids are smart, hilarious, caring little boys and I hate that I don’t get to see them every day anymore because of a divorce that I didn’t want. 

These three kids standing on the street corner selling water for their mom’s birthday present made my eyes well up with tears because it is something I hope that my boys would do as well. I passed by them and kept driving, but it was only because all I had was spare change in my cup holder and I felt like they deserved more than that. So I was off to the ATM before my intended stop at Jack in the Box. 

There was a long line at the ATM and I was TERRIFIED that I would get back to the corner they were standing at and they would be gone. Luckily for me, they were still there standing in the 90 degree heat and waving at the cars as they passed, whether they purchased a water or not. I parked my car and walked towards them, walking up to the youngest one at first. I noticed when I walked up that he had been holding his sign backwards and had no idea, which I couldn’t help but chuckle at. I also noticed a man that I assumed to be their dad sitting in an SUV around the corner. I’m a bald headed, heavily tattooed individual so I gave him a nod as I walked towards the boys just in case he had any concerns. I asked the youngest one if I could buy a water from them and he nodded his head and took me over to his oldest brother. The oldest asked if I wanted a soda or a water and I told him I would take a bottled water. He walked over to the cooler that had a Tupperware container with a handful of dollar bills and some spare change. He handed me the bottle and said “That’s a dollar, please sir”.

I took the water bottle and handed him $40 and told him “Thank you, buddy. Do me a favor and keep the change, okay?”. He looked at the two $20 bills and said “Wow....thanks mister!” like it was a Disney movie. I told him “You guys are doing something great, I hope your mom has a great birthday” and I thanked them, turned around and walked to my car. I opened the water bottle and went back to my intended day of fast food and yard work at my brother’s house. 

I’ve got to admit, that water tasted great. It was worth every penny.I did my part. I voted. I just wanted to go to bed and wake up knowing who won. Instead I wake up to see that it's a hella close election and one side demanded them to stop counting votes. Four more years is something that could actually happen right know and I'm low key scared for the future.I'm so sick and tired of always consuming entertainment... It's always meaningless youtubes videos where they're acting like we're friends, meaningless shows, ... Frankly, I've grown tired of my phone but I need it for school and to talk with some friends. I wish I had things to do but my hobbies don't take much time, I can't see friends much because of Covid and I'm really bad at sports, which make me sad lol.

I feel like we now live in an entertainment culture, a culture of constant escapism... I'm sick of it.

Anyone else relates ?  What do you do to avoid this ?

And before anyone pulls the boomer card on me, I'm 17F lolA couple months ago I (17F) was feeling kinda sad, but I had to go out because I had a hairdresser appointment. I was wearing a Pink Floyd shirt, and while walking by a house I saw an old man in his garden wearing the exact same shirt. I called his attention excitedly and pointed at both our shirts. He looked a bit confused for a second but then he realized and laughed happily, and before I continued walking he gave me a cookie.

I know this may not be an incredible story, but it really makes me happy to remember and I thought someone else could like it too.

Edit: just to clarify a couple things people have commented: 
The shirt was the one with the two hammers, from The Wall
The man was about 70 years old
And lastly, I live in a small and very safe town, and specially in that area it is normal to accept food from people, we all kinda know eachotherSo, a few months ago I was playing a survival game. In game I was repairing my clothes before hydrating and getting a full 8 hours of sleep. Then it occurred to me, why don't I do this for myself? In game my character wore the best, warmest clothes repaired to the best of my ability. I stayed well hydrated and kept a full stomach whenever possible. I cared for my tools and tried to keep myself as healthy as I could. I looked for any books to increase my skills.

And yet here I was sitting IRL hungry, thirsty, and unshaven. In game I would try to improve my skills so I could get better gear and abilities but here I was sitting at a PC learning very little. I wondered why I would treat an avatar so well while neglecting my real health. Since then I've tried to think of myself as a robot or game character. 

IRL, my body will get debuffs if I don't keep it warm, fed, hydrated, and rested. Those debuffs decrease my skills so I'm motivated to keep myself healthy so that I can progress as quickly as possible.

Life can be monotonous but people grind for xp or loot all the time in games so why shouldn't I sink some hours into a task for the hope of a better drop, leveling a skill, or finding a new questgiver? 

I have trouble making myself work out. However, it's easier if I frame it so that "exercise increases my Strength and Agility so I can unlock new challenges or areas". 

If I keep myself shaved and groomed I "get an increase to my Charisma which might unlock new dialog options". 

If I fail at something, maybe it's just because I'm "underleveled for the area and need to come back later".

In games it's generally easy to progress because they've been designed to be won. Life isn't the same in many cases, but games encourage a sort of strategic goal-setting that seems useful when it comes to self-improvement. Maybe I'm late to the party, but for some reason this idea has stuck in my head for a while now. I have a hard time motivating myself to do better but thinking about life in these terms makes learning new skills and getting new abilities seem much less complicated and more doable. I guess this is just a form of mindfulness for nerds but I've found it a lot more helpful than meditation.UPDATE: No more crow gifts just yet but I dug the bone out of my trash bin (the ones you set out every week, it was gross) and I’m going to clean it and save it. I put it in an ant hill so they can finish getting the gross parts off. Thanks for the advice and encouragement dudes! Can’t fucking believe I got gold for this hahah. Cheers! 


Since  I got laid off and have all this extra time I have been trying to make friends with the crows that live in the trees in my backyard. I feed them and I make a clicking noise at them when they’re being vocal, I match the number of times they make a noise and match the speed of it. AND IT FUCKING WORKED. A crow placed an 8 inch bone on my back patio and flew away!!! I left it there forever to see if he was coming back for it but nope! I was hoping for something shiny but this is still so freaking cool. I threw the bone away after leaving it there for a few hours and put a pile of bird seed and a shiny quarter in its place. I know I sound like an insane person but holy shit I’m so happy! Finally some good fucking newsI (23m) was in the spice isle looking for onion powder. For some reason I just couldn’t find it, so I’m standing there scanning. 

Then an older woman comes along and stands close to me. She seems to be doing the same thing. 

So I say “I hope you’re not looking for onion powder because I can’t find it” 

She says “no I’m looking for cumin! I’m making butter chicken for my kids tonight” 

Then like a switch was flipped, I started looking for cumin. And I could tell she started looking for onion powder. 

About 10 seconds after she said that, I found the cumin. Then literally 5 seconds after I found it, she found the onion powder. 

We both say thanks, I wish her luck and we go our separate ways. 

Just thought it was a cute reminder that sometimes a fresh pair of eyes can solve even the simplest of problems. And it never hurts to ask for help. 

Love you all❤️Today this showed up in my work in-box as an attachment. Everyone in the company was told to read it and "come prepared to the meeting to share your thoughts."

Here it is:

\> There was a young man who had ambitions to work for a company because it paid very well and

was very prestigious. He prepared his résumé and had several interviews. Eventually, he was

given an entry-level position. Then he turned his ambition to his next goal—a supervisor position

that would afford him even greater prestige and more pay. So he completed the tasks he was

given. He came in early some mornings and stayed late so the boss would see him putting in

long hours.

After five years a supervisor position became available. But, to the young man’s great dismay,

another employee, who had only worked for the company for six months, was given the

promotion. The young man was very angry, and he went to his boss and demanded an

explanation.

The wise boss said, “Before I answer your questions, would you do a favor for me?”

“Yes, sure,” said the employee.

“Would you go to the store and buy some oranges? My wife needs them.”

The young man agreed and went to the store. When he returned, the boss asked, “What kind of

oranges did you buy?”

“I don’t know,” the young man answered. “You just said to buy oranges, and these are oranges.

Here they are.”

“How much did they cost?” the boss asked.

“Well, I’m not sure,” was the reply. “You gave me $30. Here is your receipt, and here is your

change.”

“Thank you,” said the boss. “Now, please have a seat and pay careful attention.”

Then the boss called in the employee who had received the promotion and asked him to do the

same job. He readily agreed and went to the store.

When he returned, the boss asked, “What kind of oranges did you buy?”

&#x200B;

“Well,” he replied, “the store had many varieties—there were navel oranges, Valencia oranges,

blood oranges, tangerines, and many others, and I didn’t know which kind to buy. But I

remembered you said your wife needed the oranges, so I called her. She said she was having a

party and that she was going to make orange juice. So I asked the grocer which of all these

oranges would make the best orange juice. He said the Valencia orange was full of very sweet

juice, so that’s what I bought. I dropped them by your home on my way back to the office. Your

wife was very pleased.”

“How much did they cost?” the boss asked.

“Well, that was another problem. I didn’t know how many to buy, so I once again called your wife

and asked her how many guests she was expecting. She said 20. I asked the grocer how many

oranges would be needed to make juice for 20 people, and it was a lot. So, I asked the grocer if

he could give me a quantity discount, and he did! These oranges normally cost 75 cents each,

but I paid only 50 cents. Here is your change and the receipt.”

The boss smiled and said, “Thank you; you may go.”

He looked over at the young man who had been watching. The young man stood up, slumped

his shoulders and said, “I see what you mean,” as he walked dejectedly out of the office.

What was the difference between these two young men? They were both asked to buy oranges,

and they did. You might say that one went the extra mile, or one was more efficient, or one paid

more attention to detail. But the most important difference had to do with real intent rather than

just going through the motions. The first young man was motivated by money, position, and

prestige. The second young man was driven by an intense desire to please his employer and an

inner commitment to be the best employee he could possibly be—and the outcome was obvious.

(Excerpt from: “Living with a Purpose: The Importance of ‘Real Intent.’", Randall L. Ridd)

&#x200B;

I read it and was immediately disgusted for a couple reasons:

1. The boss had this guy working for \*five years\* and never told him he wasn't doing enough work to be promoted? The boss never made his intentions known to this guy. He was obviously a good enough employee to be kept for 5 years, but not good enough to be promoted - you don't think in 5 years the boss could have been like "Yo, you're OK, but you'll never be promoted because I don't feel you do enough extra-curriculars for me."
2. Isn't this implying that the boss values employees going "above and beyond"? That's cool and all, but doesn't this imply that employee #2 was working all this extra work \*without being paid more\*? It's like saying "You've worked here for 5 years but this guy is willing to put in more hours unpaid so he gets the promotion."?
3. Is this how you motivate employees? When someone comes in to ask why they were passed over for promotion you humiliate them? That guy went in early and stayed late, but because his \*intentions\* weren't "driven by an intense desire to please his employer (WTF?)" he is not valued as an employee. If I were that guy I'd be looking for a new job.
4. How does employee #2 have the bosses wife's cell number? That is weird.

&#x200B;

What do you guys think? Am I over reacting?

&#x200B;

Edit 7/10/19 9pm 

Y'all. Y'ALL. The meeting happened and it was \*wild\* 

It turns out the boss sent this out to everyone prompted by a single employee who is leaving for another job. 

The meeting ended with three (count 'em THREE) employees walking out on their jobs. 

I feel like writing the whole story out but I have plans tonight - when I do would it be better to put it as an edit to this post, or start a new one?You really saved our day there. I think my sister was close to having a stress breakdown because she's a new driver and couldn't get the car started when the light turned green and the people behind her kept angrily honking at us. I wanted to help her so bad but I can't drive, I dont have a license. You got out and asked us if there was something wrong with our car and when we explained to you you offered to drive for us through the red light and park us in the side street so my sister could take a moment to breath and start again without the stress of people waiting behind her. 

Thank you so much for doing that I don't know what would happened if we had stood there for much longer, she was so upset because everyone was angry at her for stalling the cars engine over and over again. Thank you.This happens to me all the time. I want to comment, but it will just get lost since it's too late and just gets thrown to the bottom of the thread. I hate it lol

Edit: Even though were at and past the 5 hour mark, I don’t consider anyone’s comment useless! This kinda blew up lolDon't really have many people to tell so thought I'd share it with y'all. I just accepted an offer for a job after a long, arduous, and soul sucking search for employment. That too, at the one company I have been trying to get into for what seems like eternity. 

I'm relieved yet not entirely sure its really happening. After MANY unsuccessful interviews and countless applications unanswered (over 1000 at the very least if I were to hazard a guess), I finally was successful.

I was laid off before covid hit and as many will know the job market has just gotten worse and worse. I questioned many things over this time, lost friendships, isolated myself into a severe depressive state wondering if there was an end to it all, but kept pushing on. There was a time I nearly gave up, and really scraped the barrel, but I guess persistence really pays off. 

Funny thing is, at the time I thought the actual interview went awful. Guess I was being extra harsh on myself.

If anyone is in a similar state, hang in there. Sounds cliché AF, but It does get better, and you'll thank yourself for you efforts when you do look back on the tough times. 

If you're also going through a tough time, shoot me a PM. I'd be happy to boost you up, or just be an ear, cause fuck knows I could've used that in the thick of it. 

TL:DR : I got a job! After feeling like utter shit for 9 months of my life, it finally happened.



*Edit: Wowowow, I can't believe this blew up! Checked my phone after dinner to see so much love from you beautiful people!! Reading some of the comments really made me smile ☺. 

I'm so glad my words were able to share hope and positivity to people out there, you never know... Good news might be coming your way too 😃. Excuse me while I pay these good vibes forward. ✌🏽

**Edit 2: special shout out to u/bananas2000's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/ispj3j/i_got_that_job_after_9_months_of_unemployment_and/g5acgr1?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3), which lists out some really useful resources for job hunters out there!

***Edit 3: My first gold! Thank you, stranger! 😁 I'm honestly at a loss for words for how many messages and comments of congrats there have been. Renews my faith in humanity. Keep spreading love, peeps!My parents were "secretly" stressing about my university tuition and today I got the chance to tell them that I'm one of the 9 chosen out of hundreds who applied for this scholarship. They were ecstatic and extremely proud. I've been keeping it a secret during the entire application process so that I'd surprise them if I got it and not disappoint them if I don't. Thankfully, things worked out perfectly and I gave them one less thing to worry about.He was ranting about some stuff that got him irritated during the day and at some point, he said we can't love more than one person in our lifetime. I told him he was being stupid,  we can love more than one person -- don't we love our parents, friends, significant others, etc? It's all a matter of different relationships and different kinds of love we feel for each person in our life.  
 And then, I jokingly said "*are you going to say you don't love me just because you have already met the love of your life?*", to which he replied "*you're absolutely right, I do love you. you're my best friend, after all*".  
The thing is: it has always been difficult for me to say things like that to other people. I can't remember the last time I said I loved someone or even showed affection towards anyone. I'm what you might call an extremely close and reserved person when it comes to relationships and affection. And hearing my best friend saying those words, well, it was good. And I really enjoyed it.   
It took me a while before answering him, but when I did I told him I love him back and how much I appreciate our friendship. Hearing those words and being able to say them back to someone meant a lot to me and I hope I can get the chance to do it more often, maybe with other friends? Well, I don't know if I'll *actually* do it so easily, but it sure would be nice.I know this sounds really boring and very uneventful, but it was a big win for me. I wanted to go the the park today and read, and as I was getting ready to go, I was planning on wearing a button up shirt with a white undershirt. I was looking at myself in the mirror with just the undershirt on, and thought “fuck it” and just untucked it and wore that. 

I’m a 19 year old male that has struggled really bad with my body image for years now, and as anyone who is a little overweight knows, a plain white t-shirt can be very revealing and can make you feel very uncomfortable. But I’ve been trying to eat better, and have been jogging a few days a week, and although I don’t look any different, I feel better. 

I wore the plain white t-shirt and went to the park and sat and read Moby Dick for about an hour before getting up and walking around the little pond I was reading by. It felt great to be outdoors and enjoying the weather, and I didn’t feel self conscious at all! I know it sounds really small and dumb but i really feel like a hundred bucks right now!I grew up with the whole mindset that only lazy people work at McDonald’s (along with other minimum wage, bag brand type of jobs) and practically refused to get a job in those types of places. Worked a few jobs (only 18 so not much experience to be had) and with covid I finally caved and applied at McDonald’s. This was my third day and just wow how wrong I was. It’s probably the funnest job I’ve had. While there’s a lot, and still a lot, to learn, I’ve been helped every step of the way, managers are nice, co-workers are nice and will help you, and it’s not for lazy people like I had grown up believing. Crazy how we can be so closed minded to someone we know nothing about! Thanks for reading just wanted to sharei recently decided to delete the facebook app off of my phone and ipad. i did keep my account up, didn’t deactivate cuz i like to look at the memories. lots of people are just so negative on there, at least in my experience. so, i decided to delete it and it’s been about 10 days and i really do feel less anxious than usual, i do have quite a few mental illnesses so i’m easily triggered by negativity. id highly recommend taking social media breaks to anyone who’s active on the platforms and feels stressed out by the apps and the posts. feeling great, just wanted to share. 💕

edit: thank you guys so much for all the medals 🏅!! i didn’t expect that at all, and i’m also so happy to hear that a lot of you guys have had the same experience. keep it up ❤️❤️I'm a delivery driver. On the phone a guy was placing an order for one pizza and felt really bad that he couldn't afford a tip. A few minutes later he calls back asking for ranch and I can hear him counting coins when I tell him how much it added, which was like $1.30. So I slipped $30 cash in with his delivery, enough to pay for it and then some, and told him not to worry about the ranch. He called back saying his driver left cash in the delivery and management sent me back there to retrieve it. So I brought him a free soda and told him to keep the money.

I hope that guy doesn't feel bad. I just wanted to help him out. I'm pissed that everyone at work found out what I did cause they were asking everyone in the store if they were missing money. I kinda feel like it defeats the purpose of random acts of kindness cause everyone knows it was me but it's whatever.

I had a great tip night last night, but not everyone is as fortunate as me these days. I still have a job and I love it. Getting paid to drive around and listen to music all day and talk to people is so fun. I wish everyone could have something to brighten their day a little.

Edit: I'm so happy so many of you were touched by my little story. I couldn't be happier that I made so many people's days a little brighter by sharing. I appreciate every comment and I'm just so glad this stuck out to you all in such a nice way. And thank you for your kind words. I hope the positivity in this thread spreads out into the world around us!So, yesterday after busting my butt for 30 days at my new job, the supervisors pulled me in to their office and said that they were letting me go, "because my skill level didn't meet expectations." They also informed me that it was because I wasn't properly trained in the job, due to the office being incredibly short staffed and entirely too busy to properly train me.

But, its okay! I'm waking up today with as positive of a mindset as one can muster up. This gives me a chance to go back to college and get a degree. This gives me more time to be home with my daughter. This gives me time to get some home improvement projects finished. I feel like I can breathe again after drowing and being thrown to the wolves at the job.

I just needed to tell someone, besides my husband. Thank you for reading!

Edit: You are all such amazing people! The support and positivity is incredible. Posting this I had no idea of the overwhelming support I was going to get. I worked for elected officials in my local government, and next week is the State's Primary election day. Thats why they are claiming there was no time to get trained. But, I am still 100% okay with it!I denied myself an Oreo and have only eaten toast(although heavily buttered) today. I'm starting to regulate my diet and I have an excersise routine. I'm so proud of this small act of discipline. Thanks for reading.
Edit: oh shit, it's only been a minute, I've got so many comments, at least more than im used to in this timeLast week was my final week of high school. I feel a little sad because I never really got to say goodbye, but more so I feel really, really proud of myself. The last 4 years have been extremely rough, but I've grown *so much* and I've come out on top, despite the odds often being against me. In the last 4 years, I've had to deal with loads of abuse, really bad social anxiety, a bit of PTSD and panic attacks (thanks to the abuse), deep depression, and so on and so forth. But no matter how hard life was constantly beating me down, I kept going. I didn't stop working for good grades and ultimately a better future for myself, no matter how low I fell. There were plenty of times where I didn't think I was going to make it, but here I am. Somehow, by some miracle, I made it - with a 4.4 unweighted GPA (bumped up past 4 due to honors/college classes and my school's grading system), multiple large projects and classes that I organized and helped teach, and 2 years early to boot. Sorry if that comes off as a little braggy, but I just feel like.....I don't know. I really did it. I didn't stop no matter how hard it got, and I managed to excel despite life constantly trying to beat me down. Those 4 short years felt like they'd never end, but now I'm able to see that it's over, I succeeded, and my whole life is waiting ahead.

I guess I feel.....relieved? It's finally over, and I'm one step closer to being free to be my own person. I have the whole world ahead of me, and it feels *amazing*. If I was able to make it through this, I'm confident that I'll be able to go through anything.

As soon as I take my SAT and get the scores back (which got delayed because, you know, global pandemic) I'm going to apply to the college of my dreams. Who knows if I'll make it, but just the fact that I have a chance makes me feel like I'm on top of the world. **I** did that. **I** got myself here. For the first time in a very long time, I'm really, really ***proud*** of myself. :D I just want to say that for anyone else who's struggling right now, keep going. Even though I'm still young and I don't have much practical experience yet, I can promise you it's worth it.

EDIT: My poor inbox, I did NOT expect this to blow up as much as it did

EDIT 2: GPA is weighted. I was just very confused about my school's system and was told some wrong information.A week or so ago, I saw an old man that I work with bobbing his head to some music. Nobody ever really talks to him and he never really talks to anyone. I’m a huge music fan(I always wear death metal shirts). I was curious what he was listening to, so the next time I saw him I asked.

Me: “Hey! I saw you listening to some music the other day and you really seemed to be jamming out.”

Old man: “Nope. Wasn’t me.”

Me: “Ah ok. I was just curious what you were listening to. I love all kinds of music and enjoy hearing other peoples favorites.”

Old man: Looks down at my death metal shirt in confusion

Me: “So... What kind of music do you like?”

Old Man: “Well.. I listen to a lot of jazz.”

Me: “Oh! I’m actually from New Orleans!”

His face brightens up as we proceed to talk about New Orleans and jazz. I ask him for some recommendations and he quickly gives me three musicians that he’s been enjoying lately. A few days later he comes up to me asking about what I thought. I gave him my feedback and asked for some more recommendations to listen to. He told me he’d think about it for a bit and get back to me. Later that day, he handed me a list of about a dozen more! I can tell he enjoys talking with me as much as I do with him.


EDIT: For everyone asking about the recommendations. I responded to comments, but figured I should put them here too.

The first three he gave me were Peter White(guitar), Norman Brown(guitar), and Rick Braun(trumpet). Through Peter White, I found and loved Dave Koz. I told him to give me more like Dave Koz and Norman Brown. Something really nice about those two. I have the lost he wrote me by my desk. Haven’t fully listened to it yet. Candy Dulfer, Chris Botti, Fourplay(who I’ve heard before), Gregg Karukas, Lee Ritenour, Marc Cohn, Neal Schon, Richard Elliott, and The Rippingtons. Long list! I have a lot of listening to do!I've been dealing with a rude abusive manager while working at a grocery store the past 5 months and last night I couldn't take it anymore and just left a note that said "I quit", silently left, and then I blocked her number and the stores number. That job paid me hardly anything, I was struggling so much financially and with how my manager was I was constantly upset and anxious. I would come into work having had a great day beforehand, feeling positive and then halfway through my shift she would tell me off for something small, or she would give me a hard time for no reason at all.

This morning I had an interview for a place that is twice as close, which is great because I don't currently have a car, and it's my first full time job!! It has great pay considering how little I made before, honestly it'll be the highest paying job I've ever had. The person interviewing me was so incredibly nice and seemed so caring and kind, it was such a relief.

I've been struggling financially my whole life and I've always been very poor. I was worried about quitting that grocery store but I just couldn't take it anymore but I actually immediately landed something better! I'm so so happy I landed this job.

Sorry if this sounds like gloating, it's not. I'm finally going to be financially stable for the first time in my life and not living paycheck to paycheck. This is the best feeling ever. I won't be rich but I will be comfortable, and thats really all that matters to me. I've dealt with so much this past year and a half and it's amazing to see some light at the end of the tunnel for once.

Does anyone have a similar experience or any thoughts? :) I hope everyone has a great day!

Edit: Thank you all so much for the support!

Edit 2: When I say 5x, I really meant 5x the amount I make in a week. Sorry for the poor wording, I was excited at the time and I honestly did not expect this post to get this much attention so I did not put too much thought into the title.I watched you walk into a sign today. No phone. Just walking. you looked up, hand on your face. You caught my eye. We stood there, looking at each other. You knew, I knew. For a second we stood together in a moment of understanding. Your shame for running into a sign, and my sorrow that someone had to see you. The beautiful moment ended, and you walked away forever. Farewell my friend.I'm not a heavy smoker or anything like that, but I did smoke 3-4 a day. I'd been trying to put a stop to it for a long time but just when I thought I'd get a hang of it some random thing would occur and I'd start again. Then one day I thought of trying again, downloaded an app to track my time and prayed let this be it. After some time I forgot about it until yesterday when I opened the app and it showed 1 month. I was genuinely surprised and it made me smile a little. 

I'm a bit of a shy person and I usually don't share my feelings with others fearing what they might say, but this made me happy inside and I thought of sharing it.

Here's to hoping that I can stick to it and finally end it. In these trying times it's the small things that can make one a better person and I'm up for that. 

Cheers people and stay safe.

EDIT: Thank you all for your kind words and support. I'm really lost for words here. I never thought I'd get such a response. You all really made my day.After years of struggling in crappy entry-level jobs, I finally decided to make a change and pursue higher education. After doing some desk jobs, warehouse jobs, working on a dealership, in pet food, and everything in between, I learned I hated most types of work. Didn’t like wearing a suit/tie, didn’t like dealing with customers. But I did find I loved welding while restoring my car. So I took a chance, applied to the most prestigious welding and fabrication program in the state...

And got in! Have a meeting to figure out how much financial aid I get today, little nervous, but very excited in general. Finally feels like I’m not just meandering through life hoping for some luck. Now it feels like I’m taking control and setting myself up for success, and I’m stoked! By the end of next year, I’ll have a *real* career and skills. It’s like a dreamEvery time I have gone for a physical since 2nd grade, my doctors have always told me I'm overweight or on the verge of obesity. I've been jogging every evening for the past few months, but didn't really notice any physical change myself. Now at 18 at my physical today, I found out that my BMI is  finally in the healthy range!I'm alone stuck in a lockdown for the past 6 months, I've been working full time from home and needed to complete my Masters this year. I had one unit left and the weeks preceding my final assessment were some of the craziest weeks of work, but I dropped the ball on my uni work. I knew my final assessment was not good and I was just trying to get it in by the deadline. Been feeling depressed lately, because of the lockdown, so I thought I knew what would make me feel worse was to I check my results. Apparently I did enough to just pass the final, and well enough on my other assessments for an overall credit avg for the subject. Had no one to tell but this is honestly making me feel a bit better.

Update: thank you everyone for the kind and lovely words, all you wonderful people with the comments and awards have really cheered me up.I recently moved to a new city, and reached out to friends to see if they knew any single women I could try and get to know. One friend responded, and set me up on a date tonight with a mutual friend from their high school. I had to drive to another town 45 minutes away, but was excited because I could finally start dating again since I got the J&J vaccine.

I put on nice clothes.

I paid for everything.

I listened intently and asked follow-up questions. 

When the conversation lulled, I added my two cents. 

I was emotionally present and invested, and tried to engage her in conversation.




She was 25 minutes late. (Normally this would be a deal breaker, but since I had to drive 45 minutes, I figured I'd stay).

She wore raggedy clothes.

She didn't ask any follow up questions. 

She didn't listen, or make eye contact, or attempt to show interest in me.

She didn't thank me or even acknowledge that I paid for dinner and drinks.

She was emotionally closed off and wouldn't connect with me in the slightest.

It started snowing, so I told her I had to go home in case the roads got bad. She asked if I wanted to meet up again, and I told her I didn't think it would work out. She got upset, and said I drove all the way out to meet her, that we should go to dinner again. I told her she was nice enough, that it wasn't personal, but that I didn't feel any chemistry. I was a little nervous to be so blunt, but it honestly felt good to stick up for myself and not give in just to not feel alone. For once in my life, I know my worth, I know I'm interesting, and I know I put my best foot forward. From the way she was undressing the waiter with her eyes, it seemed to me like she was looking for a dinner ticket, and nothing more. 

I'm really proud of myself for putting myself out there and being vulnerable. I'm really proud that for once I felt like I was in charge of my own dating life, and not just saying yes because relationships are so hard to come by. I'm proud that for once someone didn't live up to my standards, and I didn't settle.

What are you proud of in your own dating life?
How are you showing yourself your own worth?
Do you have a similar story?EAT some seafood, I never thought I’d be able to do those things again. It was a perfect, easy day and I was able to do it all without getting sick or exhausted.

EDIT: This is the mildest, most low key thing I’ve ever posted. All the great awards and upvotes make me believe this strikes a chord with a LOT of people. I hope all of you similarly afflicted people find your way out and get a perfectly nice day as well. I appreciate all the love you’ve given me for something so seemingly small and unremarkable. It was a big deal for me. Thanks for celebrating it.I spotted a little girl, about 2 years old, crying alone in shock and running around a fountain, looking around. I've lost my parents many times when I was a kid, and each was more terrifying than the previous, I immediately knew she was looking for her parents.
I approached her and she was clearly terrified of me, so I guided her to a bench nearby with as little physical contact as possible. I started asking around if they lost a child and got people's attention. People gathered around but nobody was willing to go search the mother, it's a gigantic park with tons of people around. I left her in care of an old lady who was really concerned, and moved around asking questions. People actually talked about seeing a crying mother looking for her child, so I made for the last direction they saw her going. I ended up finding her almost near the edge of the park, around 300 meters away from the kid. She had her daughter who was crying her eyes out, and her (presumably) old mother with her who guided her around, because I could see the mother was slowly giving up hope and was stalling around like a zombie when I reached her. I can't describe their faces when I told them that I found their kid and she was safe. The grandma was laughing with joy, but the mother was crying silently but looked extremely relieved.
I was surprised how far I came searching for her parents when I was guiding them to the kid. After painfully slow minutes we reached the lost child and she had around her a lot more people, and the rest was a really sweet wholesome scenery.
'Twas a good day.Next time you wash your hands, hold your hands under the water and feel the water running against them dude. You won’t regret it. 

P.S. what small thing like this makes you think about how good your life is and how much worse it could be?I still have a long way to go and had an especially rough night, but I had a good feeling when I got home in my clean car and was able to put my things down on my clean counter. It almost feels like I'm living a better person's life.

To caveat: I wasn't living with rotting food or anything, just avoiding organizing, and still unpacking after 5 months. Because of Covid ops her Walmart has separate entrances for the employees and the customers. She used one of the customer ones (haven’t asked why) and they gave her the axe. 


I know she broke a rule and it’s a legal termination, but it’s just nuts to me that they’d end her career like that.



Edit: Went to bed and woke up to this. I’ll try my best to keep replying, thanks y’all for the support. #fuckwalmartI found out through a friend’s social media that my first love is engaged to be married. After two years together and going through a lot together, she broke up with me late 2016because she wasn’t able to deal with her grad school work, working as a 1st grade teacher, and being with me, so she let me go. I wished her the best at the time and I tried to give her time to be able to work through everything in an attempt to not lose her. Sadly, we drifted apart and after trying to be a part of her life, she wasn’t interested anymore.


Read the news that she was getting engaged and while it made me sad, all I can do wish her a good life. She’ll live on in my mind as the one that got away, and she’ll always have a special place in my heart.I'm a straight guy but I met this female friend a while ago and I gotta say it's one of the best things ever. Unlike most of my male friends, we talk about our feelings and we give emotional support to each other. She tells me she loves me all the time and I just feel warm talking to her. It's so good to have someone like this, as long as you can move past any jealously or romantic intentions.Let me start off by saying that I have nothing but respect for mothers. This is only my attitude for my own body and life. 

I’m only 17, which granted, isn’t all too old at all. But babies make me wildly uncomfortable and the concept of pregnancy is downright terrifying. Everything from postpartum depression, to the physical effects of the body and how it would never be the same. And losing months of sleep for something I might end up resenting? That’s not fair to anybody. I like the idea of being a mother, but I would rather adopt an older kid and skip everything I find deeply unpleasant. I know attitudes change as you get older, but I really don’t want mine too. When I realized just how viable of an option adoption is, I felt an immense relief. I just can’t see myself doing a good job of taking care of a baby and make so many sacrifices to my own body over it.I love cloaks/capes!

From warm wool cloaks to flowy CGI superhero capes, I just want to wear them all the time.

I want to walk down the sidewalk in a breeze and feel awesome as my cape/cloak billows in my wake.

I often fantasize  about standing before an army of foes, drawing my sword from it's scabbard, and charging forward in just a glorious flourish of capes, leading my imagined army into wondrous battle.

But I feel like I can't even wear a cloak without feeling like a weirdo. Maybe if I was braver I'd wear one anyway, but alas, turns out I'm not as brave as I am in my fantasies.

&#x200B;

Edit: Oh my gosh, thank you so much for my first ever gold, and thank you everyone for supporting my first ever post all the way to the front page and encouraging me to just wear a cloak anyway!

Because of you kind redditors and your encouragement, I've officially bought my first cloak from [The Dark Knight Armory](https://www.darkknightarmoury.com/aaron-canvas-cloak) I'm also going to look into making my own very soon.

I never imagined that so many people just wanted to wear capes/cloaks like me. So, if you're seeing this post and you want to wear a cape/cloak, just do it! I'm not gonna let my fear stop me anymore.

Edit 2: Here's a list of some of the places people have linked me to get cloaks/capes from, for anyone who is interested in buying one.

Edit 3: Hey everyone! I got some requests to make a sub, so I made r/capeandcloakcrusaders.

 Now we cape/cloak lovers have a community to share our love of flowy and billowy outerwear! 

Thank you guys for all the  positivity  and support. You guys are awesome.I have a few popular posts that hit several thousand like and couple awards. Pretty cool, I guess. 

But more rewarding and touching than that is when other dudes would agree, concur, support or encourage me by saying something like "enjoy your juice, KING" or "What a KING!! KEEP GOING!!" or something like that. 

I've been seeing it much more recently on other subs too, and I think it's honestly the coolest bro-thing going on in reddit these days. 

Keep on keeping on, KINGS.I am a Korean. My job is translating video games - from English to Korean. I've been in it for over a year now. 

I work freelance - stuck at home alone 24/7. Never even met my boss. Since my girlfriend is a non-korean, I don't have anyone to react to my translation. Since I just get bunch of text lines to work on, I have no idea how it looks in-game. The games I worked on were too indie to be on Twitch. 

Up untill now...

Last Wednsday, finally, a game I worked on was played by the biggest streamers in Korea... and they liked it!

This one streamer has played the game before tranlation. He was frustrated with it. And now he was not, thanks to me. He chuckled at almost every jokes, so did his subscribers. 

So that felt nice - making impact on people, even a chuckle. So nice to have a good "a customer made my day" story to share. 

So if there are other remote workers here - don't feel underappriciated, unseen, or whatever. Know your work is making impact on people.

TL:DR - as a remote worker, I finally saw someone I made smile.

EDIT : Thanks for all the support! Not sure if I can name the game.... But again, thanks!Okay, flipping an omelette might not seem like a huge achievement. But for someone who can't really cook, someone who managed to burn rice/make soggy rice in a rice cooker (ask anyone, cooking rice in a rice cooker is supposed to be "idiot-proof", guess they didn't test it against *this* idiot....)

And for the longest time, I've been trying to make an omelette with the works, and every time I tried flipping it over, I'd end up with eggs dripping everywhere.

But today, I managed to do it, flipped the omelette properly, as a whole round disc. And I'm feeling ridiculously proud of it.

Life has been a bit rough lately. I'd take whatever little achievement I can nowadays. 

Just wanted to share this little bit of happiness with ya all. :)

Edit:

Guess this post kind of went off on its own. Thank you all for all the kind words and awards! I am most humbled that my amateur cooking attempt bring a smile to your day. 

Sorry I can't reply to all who took time to comment. My message box seemed to have exploded with all the new messages when I woke up this morning.It's been at least 3 days of nonstop protesting and revolt in major cities all over the country to combat massive corruption, sectarianism, taxes, shortages, and economic decline. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of people not just in Lebanon but worldwide are protesting. The army and the mafias trying to keep us quiet at first, tried and failed to contain people before they were overwhelmed by sheer numbers. Already one political party has resigned. The prime minister is making concessions but they are rejected, we are demanding a full government resignation. I've posted to r/worldnews twice with no traction. I just wish it got more attention so that we would get more support. The country has not been this united since 2005, when the Cedar Revolution kicked Syria out.

EDIT: For those wondering, I'm just trying to spread awareness. You can read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\_Lebanese\_protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Lebanese_protests)

EDIT2: JESUS I didn't think this would blow up! Thank you kind strangers and thank you for the gold!

EDIT3: Alright, I gotta get to work so I'm shutting off notifications. Please, if you would give gold, please donate instead. It doesn't matter where. Donate to a cause that matters to you. And make sure the charity is reputable!

EDIT4: If you wanna see a really cool video from the protests, here's one I crossposted with everyone shouting "Revolution"

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/dl5iwv/if\_you\_gotta\_protest\_do\_it\_in\_style\_lebanon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextfuckinglevel/comments/dl5iwv/if_you_gotta_protest_do_it_in_style_lebanon/)This is a huge step for me. I’m from a small town in Louisiana. Everyone knows everyone and if any of those people found out you’re gay, then that’s it. I’ve never told anyone. But, I was blessed enough to not lose my job during the pandemic. I saved up as much as I could and I did it. I escaped the small town cliche. My family and I moved to a remote island off the coast of Rhode Island only accessible by ferry. 

I’ve never complimented another guy out of fear that someone would know I was gay. Any time I get the idea, I immediately picture myself getting attacked by someone who overhears, or is offended. But now that I moved, now that I can be myself, I’m gonna do it. 

There’s this guy who works on the ferry. We’ve made small talk every time we run into each other. He wears these stark white boots that cut off right below the knees, and they hug his legs tight. He’s got a deep voice and a nice beard (from what I can see with his mask on). He’s around my age and he’s really cute. I’ve never said that before and it literally makes me cry that I can say that now.  I don’t know if he’s gay or not - and honestly, it doesn’t really matter. It’s still a compliment and I still mean it, regardless as to whether or not that compliment goes anywhere beyond kind words. 

I just wanted to share this with someone. It may be casual for others, but for me, I’m proving to myself that I’m not going to allow myself to be scared anymore. Here’s to being fearless!

EDIT: y’all he wasn’t working today 😂 I will post an update in a new post as soon as I get the chance, I promise!I (32F) was in the dollar store and some guy seemed to be following my daughter and I around quite closely. I thought it was just coincidence and that he needed to get around us or something, so I said, “Okay kiddo, come over here!” to my little girl and stood back a bit. The guy gets a surprised look on his face as soon as he hears my voice, looks over at me, and says “Oh!” and immediately turns around and heads back the other way. 

I hear voices from an aisle over as the guy, embarrassed, explains to his girlfriend that he had been following around some other lady that he thought was her. She burst out laughing and said, “HAHAHA! That poor chick! She probably wondered why the creeper was stalking her!” 

😂 🤷🏻‍♀️UPDATE2: About the fries! It’s an In-And-Out Burger thing. I do not live on the west coast so I make them myself using McDonald’s fries, carmelized onions, and homemade thousand island dressing. And to all the people who think I should go for a walk....you’re right it’s probably a good idea, and I say this with all the love in the world: No. 😊


I usually watch LOTR or Harry Potter but I’d like to see something new...

A lot of older movies I like are willow, dark crystal, labyrinth, birdcage, Mrs. Doubtfire. I like puppets and Robin Williams apparently. I think those are comforting to ME because they’re from my childhood. 

In general I like an epic adventure, whether it be sci-fi or fantasy. Some of my favorite shows are Expanse, Game of Thrones, Brooklyn 99, Parks and Rec. 

Anyway...would love to hear about what you guys watch to cheer yourself up.

EDIT: Oh my gawd you guuuuuys thanks for the awards ❤️

Avatar the Last Airbender won! Yip yip :)I mean, I’ve always know this, but it hit me while I was driving. I was listening to some old songs I loved as a 12-13 year old, and I remembered whenever we would go on a long car ride she would let me pick the music. 
I was allowed to play whatever CDs I wanted for pretty much the length of the trip. It was mostly emo bands and whinny songs about how hard life is, you know things I was an expert on at 13. 
My mom never told me to turn it off, change the song, or rolled her eyes at it. Looking back she was probably thinking how annoying and bad my music taste was as I loudly sang along to every single line. 
She never made fun of my taste in music. She never stopped me from listening to what I wanted even when she HATED it. 
I was an emotionally difficult child and she NEVER stopped me from expressing myself through my music, interests, style, ect (with the exception of not letting me pierce my lips and eyebrows.. which in hindsight is so glad for).

I hope one day I can be half the mother she has been to me.

Edit: don’t worry folks, I make her well aware of how great she is! I’m so glad to see all the sweet stories of your moms too. 
To those that have crappy moms, don’t worry. I’m your mom now. Drink water, brush your hair. I love  you, dinners at 6, don’t be late.This may sound very odd, but I am addicted to hairdryers. 

It started 5 years ago when I didn't have any heating in my flat and it couldn't be fixed, it was super cold so I started using my hairdryer to warm up. I would do it for only a few minutes but it felt good.

Then it started to become more and more frequent, to the point where I would just sit sometimes for hours holding my hairdryer and doing nothing else. I really enjoyed the sound and the warmth, it gave me some sort of comfort feeling. 

Doing it, however, stopped me from doing actual things, because as ridiculous as it sounds, if you're holding an hairdryer you can't really do much else. I would even watch movies with subtitles because obviously I couldn't hear.

It's still happening, but recently I moved into a new flat where the electricity system makes me more aware of my spending and I realised how much I really spend on it.

I also have a chronic permanent condition called tinnitus (a hearing problem caused by loud sounds, in my case) and that probably the loud sound of the hairdryer not only partially caused it but also made it worse, as my ears are constantly traumatised every time they hear loud sounds.

I keep my hairdryer plugged in 24/7 next to my couch so that is handy to use, and at night I bring it in the bedroom.

My tinnitus got very bad these last few days, and something just clicked in me and I thought 'I am making an already very bad permanent condition because of this, I am wasting loads of money and also time because I spend hours doing this instead of doing actual stuff'.

So I decided to unplug my hairdryer, and I put it in a cupboard, and I decided it won't be handy anymore, and I will use it only when I am drying my hair.

Hopefully I'll stick to this decision!

Feeling quite excited tho about my life without hairdryer, more money and more time!We were just driving along one of the main roads and I made some silly pun up just to drive her nuts and make her roll her eyes. She said after she finished groaning at the joke "You sound just like a Dad". For me, I grew up with an abusive father, verbally and emotionally towards my mother and my younger brother and myself when we went to the other parents house every other week. Afterwards she said I think you'd make a great dad and I just couldn't help but start to cry once she went inside before me to work. I feel like I'm actually becoming a man and I feel as though not having a stable father figure from the age of 8 to 21 now it's been really hard to really justify if I could ever be a good dad or roll model in the future.

&#x200B;

Just needed to really tell someone because god I love this woman.

&#x200B;

Edit: I'll be sure to tell her once we're both done work. She'll probably laugh briefly and ask why it made me cry so much but it means a lot since my father's father was the exact same with him. I said to her that if we ever have kids I don't want them to experience the emotional and verbal abuse my mother got from my dad. I was to be someone they look up to and feel proud of as their dad :)

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the awards, but go give your S/O some extra love. If you're single and reading this, don't settle for less then what you are. You're amazing the way you are. Keep being you and look for positive change. I'll be responding to more comments periodically. Thanks again all :)

Edit 3: Girlfriend has been shown the post. She says she wasn't aware of how many people were telling me to tell her about how much it meant with what she said. She wants everyone to know that if anyone is struggling with an abusive, or a hard relationship to try your hardest to help that person or yourself. Not everyone can be strong or supportive so lean on whoever is willing to listen or help. 

I myself will be replying more and if anyone needs a friendly and well conversed person to vent or distract their mind I'm available to talk whenever. Stay positive and kind Reddit <3I've been learning how to play the guitar for about two months and i suck at it but today i managed to play The Unforgiven by Metallica without a single mistake. I learnt a sort of easier version that my curriculum provides but I'll be damned if I'm not proud as heck.My neighbor is always friendly but when he sees me he repeats the same story, asking if I lived in the building, talking about the weather etc. I later found out it was because he had suffered from a brain hemorrhage a few years ago that he lost part of his memory. We always have a nice chat, and I try to add something new in each time. But today, I cycled past him on his way out and he says hey! And smiles and winks at me, with recognition in his eyes. It really made my day.This means a lot to me. I've isolated myself from society and people years ago when I was 12 years old, im 20 now, so I'm coming out and socializing again with baby steps. 

So right now, I'm socializing by playing my xbox. Today, I put on my game- Sea of Thieves and I met these 3 wonderful guys on my second time joining a random match. Off the start, they were all friendly and welcoming. They treated me like another human being which is sort of rare in the gaming community, imo.

I really enjoyed playing with them. I laughed with them, we shared funny jokes and we all had a lot of fun battling, pvping and doing all sorts of wholesome things in the game. In the end of our fun gaming, we all did a 'cheers' with our cups and congratulated each other for being good lads and teammates. I almost broke down at that point, off mic.

 Also, today is the first time I used my microphone and fighting my fear of talking. They didnt judge how I sounded, which I really have troubles with liking and embracing my voice. They didnt call me names. They didnt look down on me for being a girl who plays games.

Honestly, even though I've stopped playing xbox since 2014... these guys are the sweetest people I've ever met. 

Some people will look at this like it's nothing, 

But I will cherish this moment. In my heart. 

Good ending, they all added me. I now have 4 friends on my friends list. The 4th one is my second account. 

Good night. Just wanna write my memorable little story on here. If it's a wrong sub, I'm new so help me out also if my English and phrasing is weird, English is my second lang. So pardon the errors

Edit: uh good morning ....Thank you all for these rewards and stickers o.0 ... literally. And all your supportive comments/replies ^ ^ Also your very sweet dms:))

Edit: spelling. And the number of friends on my friends list, I wrote this at 4 am my brain put 5 instead of 4, lol my bad!So today’s a holiday called “Setsubun” and it’s one of my favorite Japanese holidays. It celebrates the coming of spring and it’s mostly about bringing in fortune into the house and driving bad spirits out.

But what I like about it is the traditional food during this day. It’s called, “Ehou-maki” and it’s this gigantic foot-long wrist-thick sushi roll that you have to eat continuously in silence. You have to face the lucky direction of the year (which is south south-east in 2021) and eat the sushi roll while thinking of your wish.

I find it funny how you must not slice the sushi roll and eat it in one sitting, no talking, most of the times just facing the wall, and concentrating on your wish while you avoid choking.

My wife and I usually end up laughing midway. But I love the flavors they sell at the supermarkets. I would usually get a crisp pork cutlet sushi roll, while she would get an avocado salmon omelette sushi roll. It’s like a Japanese burrito made of rice and nori seaweed.

And the best part? Those sushi rolls sold at the supermarket go on 50% off sale by night. I think we’d be having sushi rolls for dinner every day this week!Trust me, I like food. Food is good.

But I waste so much damn time getting it, making it, eating it, and cleaning after.

I have to go to the store every couple days for a couple hours, cook an hour a day at least, and take an hour eating.

I would save so much time if I could just take a pill and not worry about it.

What are y’all thoughts?I've always loved Lego and I wanted to do this project for my kids (2 year old son and 4 year old daughter). I found the perfect activity table, solid wood, storage, top flips, so I went to work early, picked the table up, got flat Lego sheets and glue, picked up a big pack of Lego from the store and got home a little late with a new activity table (3 feet by 4 feet, so pretty big) to show everyone.

The kids were super excited and my wife was super excited but she usually gets over the top excited about stuff the kids love to bond with them so I didn't think anything of it. But after the kids were in bed she didn't want to do anything we normally do, she just wanted to play with the Lego table!

I don't know how we never talked about this being together for 9 years but she had a little Lego kit as a kid and always wanted a big table and she was genuinely excited when I bought it all home.

I just wanted to share that I spent about two hours with my wife sitting on the floor building Lego cars and I just fell a little more in love with her seeing her enjoy herself like a kid.Carne asadas are basically the Latino/Hispanic, or in my specific case, South L.A. version of having people over for a barbeque. Parents would always know a friend of a friend that would invite eachother to the next carne asada. 


While the adults would dance and have drinks (while listening to the same cumbia hits playlist that no one ever seemed to update), my sister and I would have to hang out with the other kids that were also dragged there and it was up to us youngsters to find our own entertainment. 


It was always the go-to classics like tag or hide & seek. Sometimes we'd make up games and just b.s. the rules along the way. Other times we'd share ghost stories or urban legends just to see who would get spooked out first. If the adults were in a good mood, they'd rent a bouncy house just for us kids.


It was back in the time of our lives where you'd make friends with the other kid just because you shared the same favorite color, or had the hottest pokémon card at the time. There was no difference between girls or boys, we were all just kids laughing and running around without a care in the world. 


My favorite part of it all, however, was when one of my parents would realize I was really sleepy late in the night, prompting them to drive me back home so I could rest. They'd drop me off and drive back to the party so I was left home alone (most of the time the parties were nearby, only from a street or two across). I would lay down in bed as soon as I got home, and just stare out the window from my room to see the streetlights. The music and people from the party could still be heard very faintly. I'd hug my blanket each time I'd hear a car pass by, and I'd realize I was happy. I'd drift off to sleep with nothing but a relaxed smile on my face. 


I know carne asadas obviously still happen all the time, but I only just realized that as a 20-something year old, I haven't gone to one in almost 13-15 years. (And as an introvert, I also laugh when I remember how social and talkative I was as a kid). 


Maybe when this quarantine is all over (plus an extra few months just to be safe), I'll grab a few friends, a few drinks, the cumbia hits playlist that never gets updated, and just chill for a night. It's been a while since I've done that.


Edit 1: I didn't expect this to blow up but guyyys, you guys are making me emotional with all of your own personal stories. I love reading them all! I guess I wasn't aware how much this hits home for so many others. If you guys are ever in the area, and I hosted a carne asada, you're all always invited.


Edit 2: So I couldn't come up with a full fleshed out playlist but these are some of the songs I can remember being played. They're not really cumbia, moreso a mix of spanish favorites: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLIROWpflh_0a6VhDp087F-COHfQ3cM1I

Edit 3: u/WGPorscheSpyder made a spotify playlist!! https://open.spotify.com/playlist/671zqnbaG49XH7MidYtm10?si=w89E0deURd2bvTfz286YpAI was just smoking a cig in my backyard and my neighbor's kid was playing in their back yard. The kid saw me and started talking to me a bit then she climbed over the fence like a little ninja. The fence gave her a small scratch on her hand so I went to get her a bandaid and some bubbles and now I have a five year old friend I guess. The kid even got me to do a cartwheel I haven't done one of those in years.

Edit for clarity: The kid didn't actually scold me I'm just the type that feels accosted if a stranger so much as makes eye contact with me. Also apparently five year olds are not toddlers.As a woman, I’ve been feeling like men don’t get enough love. Especially in this day and age, with all the sexism that goes on. But I KNOW there are guys with good hearts out there, and if you’re not getting the appreciation you deserve, then I’ll say it. I appreciate you. Because at the end of the day, every individual makes an impact on the world. And if you’re doing your part to be a good person in this world , then thank you. 

And just a reminder. Many guys experience abuse from women, and it gets overlooked. If you’re a man who’s experiencing that, don’t let anyone put you through that. Know your worth, and remember that just because you’re a guy, doesn’t mean you don’t deserve respect. Respect goes both ways.

EDIT: I used the word feminism and it was misunderstood. My apologies.

EDIT: wording

EDIT: Thanks so much for the golds and silvers <3. I’m so glad that so many of you were touched by this post. I know that nobody is perfect, but keep being your awesome selves.14 years ago, I was in the third grade. My teacher was a beautiful, tall blonde haired/blue eyed 24 year old woman, ‘Miss A’. All the boys in the class had a giant crush on Miss A, including myself. 

My Dad had divorced my mother 2 years prior after her party lifestyle became too excessive. She took off to another state with her short lived fling and my father got sole custody of me. He had said he needed a break from dating after all the hell he went through with my mother, but that didn’t stop him from flirting with all the pretty women we’d come across while out and about.

Miss A and my father had met before at the open house and they would see each other every day at pickup as she released the students to their parents. However, they didn’t really talk until the parent teacher conference. Not to brag, but I was always a really good student who got good grades, so Miss A didn’t have much to talk about with my father when it was his turn for the parent-teacher meeting. Instead, the half and hour they spent together turned into them sharing their life stories. They hit it off really well and exchanged numbers.

Within a few months, Miss A and my father were dating. Nearly a year later, he proposed. They’ve now been happily married for the past 12 years and I’ve added 6 little sisters! To this day, I still don’t understand what my teacher saw in my father. He was a 40 something, overweight, typical flirty single dad when they met, yet she was able to see past all of that because she loves him for him. It’s encouraged me to never give up on love! Often times it’s the most odd looking couples that are the happiest. My father and stepmom are the perfect example of that!

It’s crazy to me that had it not been for my ‘perfect record’, Miss A would have had something to talk about with my father besides the small talk that would turn into so much more. I often tell my sisters they have my good behavior to thank for their existence 😆I was on zoom with a few of my classmates for a group project, when were in regular class not everyone turns their camera on so we didn’t see each other that much but since we were only 8 we all put them on. This guy was talking and I notice something different about him. We had been texting earlier so I just texted him back “btw did you get a haircut?” We were still on zoom and I could see him checking his phone, he replies “yeah last Thursday” and I said “I knew there was something different! Suits you!” To which he said “really? I thought he kinda messed up” at this point I saw him put his phone down to continue talking to the other group member about the project. I decided I’d reply now or I’d forget and he’ll just answer whenever he’s done, I said “nah you look handsome!” (He really did, this man is stunning honestly) and I just set my phone on the side and looked back at the meeting not thinking much of it. However I see he’s looking down and the message gets seen almost instantly. Cue the biggest, cutest grin I’ve seen on this guy. He’s the shy type and isnt really showing lots of emotions so seeing him with that goofy smile was so heartwarming. He even sort of lost his trail of thought and had a giggle mid sentence. He put a lil heart react on it and changed the subject back and we kept on texting. Now I’m not sure if he was happy just because of the compliment or if he was extra happy because it came from me, we’ve been texting for a bit and I must say I sort of have a crush on this guy. Even if he doesn’t I’m still glad I gave him a sincere compliment and it made him happy. Just wanted to share as I thought it was cute!I was sitting in the bus next to an old man (60 years old). He was playing 4 pics 1 word and just couldn't figure it out. After a minute, I asked him if he wanted some help. He looked at me with such hopeful eyes and when I gave him the answer, he was so happy. I never thought that such a little thing could bring so much happiness.

Edit: I'm sorry if I offended anyone by saying that 60 is old. But as someone in her mid 20s, 60 feels old.I'm just an amateur, but I show my work a little, and get positive feedback.  This guy went to the trouble to seek out my work, and treated me like I was a pretty significant person in the local art world.  

He's a pretty successful artist himself, which makes it all that much better.

Gotta admit, that's a good feeling.Hi there, I'm from Mexico, I wouldn't call myself poor or anything

i've been to USA at least 20 times (I'm 19 yrs old) and damn it literally never ceases to amaze me

In Mexico we see only mexicans really, some people look good, some other nah, and some average, but everyone's well, mexican

Now I LOVE seeing black people, asian people, indian, white people, muslim people, I LOVE seeing the diversity here, it's refreshing and awesome

I personally feel more attracted to whiter women (not racist AT ALL, I'm open to anything but I just tend to feel more attraction towards them than other races , and in just a day I've seen more 10's than in my town in 3 years

I love how modern everything is , how every single restaurant has mobile orders & pickups,

In Mexico AT&T is just a mobile carrier, in USA it is a TV provider, wifi provider, mobile carrier, and even a TV chain with specials and AT&T exclusives what the hell?? Comcast doesn't even exist in Mexico, Starbucks menu in Mexico is like 1/4 of the menu in America, Dairy Queen only offers ice cream in Mexico, while in USA it sells hamburgers & nuggets & fries and has a mobile app for odering food & picking it up!


The houses are so beautiful in America, the roads are so smooth and driving is soooo easy and nice to do here

In summary your country looks like a capitalist dream, a nice place with beautiful houses, beautiful roads, moden cities & beautiful and diverse people while our country looks like it's constantly trying to look like that, having success in some areas, and failing MISERABLY in a lot of other areas
In general, I love how modern everything is and the overall vibe here every place has 


AC if it's hot outside or hot AC if it's cold outside 



I'm just so happy to be here and shocked with every single modern amenities offered here!!
I wasn't even fat but i really wanted a 6 pack, dropped 18kg in the first 4 months just by cutting out sugar and lowering my portions. Finally got the abs after a few months work and it was well worth it. I don't even get tempted when i look at chocolate or candy or whatever, i just feel like it's dog food or something and it's not meant for me. I have completely forgotten how it tastes like and i have absolutely no regrets. Just posting this to say I'm proud of myself and if there's someone out there that needs the motivation then i hope you get motivated by this post. First two weeks are hard then after that it's ironically a piece of cake...

Edit: HOLY SHIT THIS BLEW UP. I went to sleep when it had like 22 upvotes and I woke to 4.2k haha. 

First of all, thank you all SO SO MUCH and I'm trying to reply to everyone but there's been so many messages and I'm doing best replying to every single one of you.

Okay now the most common question was if i did cut out fruits and vegetables as well. What i meant was processed sugar and I'm sorry about the terminology. Regarding what i cut out I'll just leave it here.

I've cut out candy, chips, junk food, soft drinks ( I've always hated them even without the diet, i only drink water. no coffee no tea no beer for all of those asking, only water alone.) I also gave up bread for a few months but i have it now every once in a while  ( anything that contains flour basically ) for now this is all i can think of if you have anymore questions about the food I'll gladly answer them. I DID have fruits and vegetables, I'd be crazy not to since the whole point of this is about eating healthy and i still need carbs for my workouts. I have an apple, half an orange, broccoli and a couple of bananas per day. I don't go crazy on them but i just have enough.He's not out of the woods yet, but my mom just picked him up from the hospital! He first showed symptoms on December 2, was admitted to the hospital on the 11th. The 13th-16th every text and phone call felt like it could be our last. He'll be on oxygen, and we don't have his CT scan results yet, but we'll finally get to hug him! Go hug your family if you can. And please, take it from someone whose perspective has changed A LOT in the last 3 weeks, wear a mask!

Edit: Offering a little more detail. He was on 15L of O2 for the first week, with blood oxygen saturation levels between 75% and 85%. Currently, when resting, he is in the low to mid 90s. When he gets up go to the bathroom it dips to about 80%. He is at 4L of home oxygen.

And thank you for the silver, kind internet stranger. Also, the wholesome, other kind internet stranger!... I did not expect this kind of response. Thank you all times 1000!

Edit 2: and the hugz and other silver and all the positive, supportive comments. What a wonderful community! Not to get all sappy, but I am sincerely grateful for all the kind words. And for all the people going through this, too, I'll be keeping you close in my heart. Community is a powerful weapon against isolation and sadness. I'll probably share this with my dad tomorrow even though I don't think he really understands Reddit.

Last edit: I've seen several comments about people being frustrated with other people for only advocating for things like staying in, social distancing, and wearing masks *after* we've been effected (if you think that's me, I ask that you do some scrolling and read some of my comments). I understand that frustration. Yes, you've been advocating for these protective measures all along, if everyone approached this the way you've been this entire time, we wouldn't be where we are today. But I would argue that people whose views have shifted are going to be just as, if not more, effective in convincing those that remain to be convinced that this is a dangerous thing that needs to be taken more seriously. Some people are mad at me, fine, be mad (also... read my comments). But maybe consider that just because some people's journey and arrival at the truth isn't your ideal, doesn't mean that they can't be fellow harbingers of that truth. Did people get mad at Christopher Reeve for only raising money for spinal cord injury research *after* he was paralyzed? I realize the potential for contracting this virus is far greater than everyone in the world becoming a paraplegic, but hopefully the purpose of my metaphor isn't lost.

Ok, I lied... maybe this is the last edit: Thank you everyone for you well wishes, I'm sending you all some, too. I've tried to keep up with all the comments, and if I missed you, I'm sorry! If you scroll down and read more of the threads, you'll find that I've made a lot of mistakes. Some of which I'm still finding out about. You might find things that make you think less of me, and that's ok. My main objective in posting this last night was to hopefully reach people like me, who also need to change. Yes, it sucks that it's taken this long, and I feel like a fool; but I'd rather be thought of as a fool and take this seriously now, than go on with the mindset I had before.Do y'all not like it too? It's nice and heartwarming!I grew up poor. When I got new shoes, which wasn't often, my parents would buy them several sizes big "so you can grow into them." Stuffing the toe with tissue and tightening the laces to the max possible tightness was just...what you did when you got shoes.

Well, I've worked really hard to live a better life, and now that we're comfortable we have a toddler. The other day, my in-laws sent him new shoes. They were a couple sizes big, and my husband commented that we'd need to get a size down before he wore them, but I stuffed the toes and tightened them--he'll grow into them! 

"What?!" Husband looked at me like I had two heads. 

Then it hit me. "You had all the shoes growing up, didn't you?"

"What do you mean, all the shoes?"

"Like you got to wear all the sizes they made?"

 "...yeah...?"

And I just realized that we are a household that can afford *all the shoes.* It sounds silly, but I'm so happy, I'm tearing up just writing this. 

I always wanted to make sure I could give my kid a better life than I had. And he's going to have that. Starting with shoes that actually fit.Married at 18.   Three sons by the age of 23.  Fast forward another 23 years, and I find myself as an empty nester.  Wondering if I was the best Dad I could have been.  Hoping that I could relive some of the most precious moments of my life. Wishing I had another day with them...as little ones...needing their Daddy's advice and help. Missing them deeply...thinking how fast life turns on you. Months turn into years, and you wake up one day...and they're gone.

I remember getting the phone call.  "Dad, we're pregnant.  You're going to be a grandpa."  I was unsure. I wasn't ready, I feared.  I was too young.  I didn't have a cane, nor a rocking chair. I owned not a single velcro beige shoe.  Now, 4 years old...I feel so blessed to have this opportunity to teach...to mold...to care for and nourish.  My fears of being a grandpa gone.  The look in his eyes when he sees me. Watching him grow. I feel like I have another life to give to a child. Playing on the floor, making cardboard forts...joking and laughing and tickling. Plenty of tickling.

I'm smiling as I embrace this part of my life...and, I can even still wear my Jordan's.

Edit:  wow!! 4k thumbs up!! Thank you for all the kind words! I read each one.

Edit: Whoa! Nearly 9k! I'm glad I shared some of my thoughts!I work at a veterinary hospital. I went outside to take a walk on my break. It’s sunny out, a little too humid for my tastes but I walk anyway, playing Pokémon GO on my phone and swiping all the stops along the front of the hospital. A little strange to think there are so many animals here, and I’m walking around catching Pokémon. 

Behind me, an older lady walks to her car. She’s by herself, and sniffling a lot. I turn around to look and see that she’s crying. She’s holding an empty leash. I can only imagine what that means. 

I ask if she’s okay, and without really waiting for her answer I ask if she wants a hug. She nods, and I hold her. She sobs a bit. She hugs tightly and as she starts to let go she hugs a little tighter. She repeatedly says thank you. Thank you so much. For all you do to help the little ones here. I don’t respond, I just keep hugging her. I start tearing up, too. 

Eventually she lets go. I hold put my hands on her shoulder and give her a look to communicate that I share her sorrow. I’ve lost all ability to speak. I wish I could say something, anything. Offer her something more. But instead I watch her get into her car, and I turn and continue walking.

Given the panic, and the misinformation flying around, we are announcing a ~~temporary~~ moratorium on posts related to Coronavirus (Covid-19). 

Useful subreddits you can go to instead: 

/r/Coronavirus 

/r/COVID19Up until now we have been pretty lenient in regards to Rule 2, which states that post must describe *why*  the YSK is useful. We have approved posts that didn’t state why the  knowledge is useful under the guise that its usefulness was implied.  However, due to an increasing number of these types of posts, we feel it  needs to be addressed. Therefore, starting now we will be enforcing  Rule 2 more heavily. All posts must include (in the text body) an  explicit statement of why the post is useful. Even if you think the  reasoning is obvious, you still must explicitly state it. This should be  done by having a simple “**Why YSK:**” in the text body. (Just for those who might not know, the text body is the area where you can put additional text after the title text when creating a post.) *Please note that it should go in the text body -- not the title or the comments.*

Remember that this sub is focused on self-improvement on how to do things, improve on activities, skills, and other tasks.

*BASICALLY:*

* All posts must include a "**Why YSK:**" (typed just like that) section in the text body.

\[\[Additionally, we want to take this time to remind everyone that [r/YouShouldKnow](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/)  is not a place to share personal stories or anecdotes. If you feel your  post needs to include one, a brief anecdote is fine. The entire (nor the majority of the) post should not be about your own personal experience, however. We will be removing posts that are just personal anecdotes.\]\]

**Why YSK:** We (the YouShouldKnow moderators) hope it will improve readers' abilities to better understand the purpose of the sub, mentioned above and in the expanded Rule 1. For thread creators, it will help in their ability to explain how the reader can improve upon a certain skill, task, or ability. It will also help the creator improve upon the skill of not having their post deleted due to not including "**Why YSK**" in the text body of their post.

*NOTES:*

* Bolding the words **Why YSK:** will make it a lot easier for people to find it.
* Again, please put **Why YSK** in bold letters. It's easier to find in a sea of text.
* **Why YSK** must be followed by an actual explanation as to how it helps someone improve upon a skill, task, or activity. Following it with a massive personal anecdote is not the point -- neither is following it with "I think this is important" or something similar.Why YSK: if ever you need this, this could literally save your life one day. It is also useful if you have lost your passport and can’t get home. And the UK has embassies in most of the world’s countries. 

For instance if you are stuck in Ukraine right now and your home nation doesn’t have an embassy in Ukraine. You can go to the British Embassy to ask for help as if it was your own. They can set you up with an emergency passport and help you leave.Why YSK - it takes about a minute and could brighten up a sick kids day! 

https://www.stjude.org/get-involved/other-ways/valentines-day.htmlWhy YSK: When I was searching for a house I met with a builder to see what houses were available. They later proceeded to give me a report that supports their claims that they were the best builder in the state.

And according to their numbers... They were... At least in terms of output. They certainly were the best... At pumping out new house faster than any other builder.

But you know what that told me? That I'm terms of quality they were far from the best. Because at my price point there's no way their quality would be that good. So I moved on. And it was thanks to my knowledge about the triangle of cost, quality, and time.

On this triangle, you can occupy any side of the triangle to take advantage of any two attributes. [link for reference](https://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/~steve/best/tri.html)

For example. If something is produced fast, you can choose for it to either be cheap or of good quality. It can't be both. If it's fast and cheap, then the quality is going to be bad. If it's fast and good quality then it's not going to be cheap. 

Yes, there are factories and machinery to improve output of a product so you can get a high quality product made at low cost very quickly, but the company had to fork out a bunch of money to build the machinery in the first place with hopes of recouping their losses. So the cost was still high to make something fast and of high quality. Plus, you can also argue that a lot of time would have to go into the planning of the assembly line and such.

So before you invest in anything whether it be a car, house, or a business partner, consider the triangle and ask yourself what kind of product you want.There's a really good Numberphile video on this, but the main takeaway is that, because kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared, braking distance/time (which brings the kinetic energy to zero at a full stop) also scales proportionally to velocity squared. 

For example, imagine two cars of the exact same mass, one travelling at 50mph and the other at 70mph. They are travelling next to each other and see a wall ahead, braking at the same time. The 50mph driver stops just before the wall; intuitively you'd think the other driver hits at about 20mph, however it hits the wall at roughly 50mph. There's some wiggle room for things like braking efficiency at higher speed and reaction time for real world, but it's something to keep in mind for deciding your speed on the road.

More food for thought: if a drive takes an hour at 60mph, it'd take about 51.5 minutes at 70mph, so you shave about 8-9 minutes off while increasing stopping distance by about 50-100ft (depending on braking strength, according to paper I found, source on request because I'm on mobile and don't want to format right now).

Why YSK: Driving is a major part in everyone's lives but also incredibly dangerous and keeping in mind how your speed affects your stopping distances can greatly increase your safety with little impact on normal commute times.Why Ysk, Most seasoned motorcycle riders know this and it only really applies to places that have a winter season.  During winter months salt and sand are laid down during storms all winter.  This sand and salt collection is a serious hazard for motorcycle's.  The sand and salt likes to collect in pockets near turns on edges of the road where the tires of other vehicles normally dont go.  If you get in this sand/salt it can cause you to lose control. So for any new riders be aware.  This normally clears up after the first good rain of the year but you should always be on the look out for it.Why YSK? A lot of people tend to believe that disabled people only have ONE form of aid. And that if they aren’t using the aid they typically use or you associate with then, they’re faking it or magically less disabled. Most disability’s don’t magically disappear and its very rude to accuse a disabled peeve of faking their disability or asking them if they’re “less disabled” now.

Disabled people have many different types of aids they use for different things. Someone may use a cane one day and a knee brace the next but that doesn’t make them any “less disabled” they previously were.If you notice something wrong with someone's appearance, don't point it out unless it can be fixed in 20 second or less. 

Loose hair, food in teeth, untucked shirt, etc. are all things that can be fixed very quickly. Acne, weight, etc. take a long time to fix, and the person you're talking to probably already knows about the problem, and drawing attention to it can make them self conscious.

Why YSK: Most people want to look their best, and finding out that something was wrong at the end of the day can be a bit disheartening. Politely pointing a small issue out can help them feel better about their appearance, even if only slightly.

(Time frames for this rule vary. I've seen recommendations from 5 seconds all the way to 2 minutes, so basically just have discretion)Why YSK: Many  of the best news sources on the internet unfortunately require payment  to access their content. For example, the newspaper I like to read; The Financial Times, costs something like **$55 a month**,  but through my uni it's completely free. While there are workarounds  involving browser extensions, inspect element, etc., they don't always  work, are a pain sometimes, and inconvenient. Because of this, you  should check with your University library (which you pay for anyway) if  they offer access.

Again, you  could access it without any payment, through unpaywall and 12ft.io like  it, but this way you get to support actual journalism because actual  journalism costs money to do. Moreover, newspapers that are subscription  based aren't beholden to advertisers, and they don't need to do  clickbait headlines (\*cough\* Independant.co.uk \*cough\*).

As  a sidenote, even if your university doesn't offer access, you might  still be able to get a steep discount. For example, the Atlantic is a 60  dollar a year subscription but is only 30 dollars a year with a student  email.Why YSK: Your diet is not only a supply for energy but also has important signaling functions of genes. Many micro- and macro metabolites of the food you eat, work as ligands to nuclear receptors in your body. This way they work as switches of genes. 
Thus it is important to eat mostly foods that we know to be healthy, not only for your weight, but also for your metabolism and overall function of the body. Humans haven't had enough time evolutionally to adapt to the current diet, making cancers, heart diseases, metabolic diseases, like type 2 diabetes, mostly man-made diseases.
The diets consisting of deep-fried foods or not eating vegetables, has huge effects to your body. Please take care of your diets.

But they should not be added to the dryer any time you are including items that absorb or repel water.  The sheets leave a coating on all fabrics that interferes with the fabrics design.

&#x200B;Not sure whether this is better tagged under "Animals & Pets" or "Finance" because it applies to both.

Why YSK: most people expect that if they make their payments on time and have a good credit score, their care credit account will remain open. This isn't accurate and there's plenty of stories online of people having their accounts cancelled out of the blue. The general consensus seems to be that they assess and cancel the accounts of people they aren't making money from (e.g. the people that pay off their totals during promotional interest free periods). They will not warn you in advance, you will only receive notice after the action is already taken.

Anecdotally this just happened to me and I have a credit score of 700, never once made a payment late, and used the card once every 6 months to ensure my cat's cancer hadn't come back. But I always paid within my promotional 3 month interest free period as well, which I'm guessing is why I got the axe. Now I just... can't afford those tests and just have to hope she doesn't get cancer again. It's stressful to think about the effect this will have on my credit score moving forward since it's a credit card as well.Why YSK:

im pretty good at keeping my stuff secure but one of my accounts were in a breach and someones been trying to change all my stuff. 2FA literally kept them out of anything important (banking, steam that has other sensitive info), and stuff that wasnt 2FA’d had the passwords changed. 

all is well, moral of the story, 2FA your stuff.

The already phenomenal service Kanopy has a somewhat hidden section just for kids with tons of great content. 

The kids section of the app (smart phone and smart TVs, Apple TV, etc) is found in the “More” menu. 

It has content like Sesame Street, other PBS content, learning languages, a whole section on myths and fables, story time, and lots of Jim Henson content.

Why YSK:  with so many ubiquitous streaming options and so much kids content it’s refreshing to have quality educational material available for free and without ads. For those who don’t know about Kanopy it’s an amazing streaming service that is accessible through your library card (US). Most universities in the US and some abroad in many counties also have access. 

(And they have one of the best non-kids collection of content as well!)Why YSK: Wolfram alpha is too expensive for students. But its app is cheap and it deserves its price.

Search the app on app store/google play/windows store. Depending on your country, you may be able to get it for less than a dollar due to local pricing.Although getting up early on a regular base is seen as a positive trait, this is against the nature of many humans. In general, there are people who will sleep and wake up early as well as people who go to sleep and wake up very late, even if they have the same need for e.g. 7 hours of sleep per night to be rested.

Why YSK: Acting against this inner [chronotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotype) on a regular basis will lead to sleep deprivation, even if a person is in bed at the expected time and doesn't get up earlier that planned.

This also effects the time during the day when people have their best performance. Early risers might have a productivity peak in the early hours while night owls get most done in the evening or at night.

Individuals cannot adapt their sleeping schedule as much as they want, or more common, society requires. An early riser won't perform well in the late hours in the day and vice versa.Even in the trades, it is incredibly common to see people use the old arm at a 90°, wrapping cords, hoses and such around the bottom of the arm, up to the hand and forcing (often twisting) loops into a haphazard coil.


The result is often a hose or cord than wants to 'spring up' and uncoil itself unless sufficiently tied or secured. The variations of coiling them that involves aggressively tying and twisting the cords in figure 8s is even worse.


WHY YSK: You're destroying your cords, literally breaking the individual wires and leave an absolute bird's nest for the next person to use it. Especially with extension cords, if it gets wrapped up too many times against it's natural curve it will become impossible to coil it cleanly (even if you're doing it the right way)


To do it correctly hold either hand at waist height in front of you. Then create decent sized loops with your other hand using the natural curve of the hose or cord (you'll know it's following the curve because it won't twist on you), holding the top of the loops with your outstretched hand. On a new cord you should easily coil it up - and if you did it correctly it should stay like that when you place it somewhere (without even having to tie it up, what a thought!)Why YSK:

I'm not 100% sure how it works, but the "feminine wash" i.e. vagisil or similar seem to break down jizz instead of solidifying it.

Especially helpful for those with teen boys, or just women who don't want to deal with the aftermath of jizz on the body. Packaging and supply chain expert here... who happens to be into wine for context of this post.

Why YSK: Broken glass after a move is never fun, whether financially or logistically. Follow these steps for less glass breakage on your next move!

I had a move several years back with a ton of large Riedel varietal-specific glasses as I hosted wine tastings from time to time and found that the right glass added an additional facet of the education piece. Burgundy glasses are super difficult to transport due to a lip that protrudes from the bowl of the glass.

I normally don't have an issue transporting them myself, but I couldn't necessarily fit all the glasses in my personal transport so I had to let the movers do it. When moving really fragile stuff, the best advice I can give is:

* Individually bubble wrap all items in a box, regardless of how unlikely that item is to break. Pay attention to the stress points in the item -- for wine glasses, the lip, stem, and foot.
* Get cardboard boxes with handles. Reinforce handles with packing tape. Walmart's supply chain has the adage, "Anything that looks like a hand hole, is a hand hole." This goes for crates as well.
* Similar glasses with glasses. Pay attention to the weights of the individual glasses. Heaver glasses go on the bottom, but anything with a step shouldn't have anything stacked on it.
* Label the box as fragile and make a note that nothing should be stacked on top of the box. It limits the movers' ability to cube their truck, but as long as you keep it to less than 5-10% of the entire move by volume, they should be able to find a spot. Having crates instead of cardboard boxes negates the need for a stacking restriction.  

   * Fun fact: Even 50lbs beef boxes have a stacking restriction -- four or five high.
* When movers arrive, inspect the glasses before they leave and be ready to document any findings with a written and signed understanding that there will be a claim filed for damages. This is where the tilt and drop sensors work best; to quantify the claim made. I guess, this should also go for all the TVs. The TV-mover boxes sold at big box stores do a solid job but a drop is a drop.

Luckily, I had one glass out of 250 break using this method, and it was because I skimped on the bubble wrap while also leaving it at the edge of a box. On the flipside, I've had 20% of all Riedel glasses shipped to me via their on-premise program arrive broken. That said, they've always replaced glasses -- and it's not really a valid comparison as parcel shipping company is a significantly different operation from a moving company.Why YSK:

Here are some common questions about the program:

**Q: How do I actually use the program?**

*A: Here is a* [*video walkthrough*](https://youtu.be/bVD4knWjATs)

**Q: Does this cover federal and state taxes?**

*A: Some of the programs will file your state taxes for free as well, but the majority require you to pay*

**Q: What type of income is the $73k/year referring to?**

*A: The number is based off your adjusted gross income (AGI)*

**Q: Does the income limit change based on your filing status?**

*A: No, even if you're married filing jointly, your income cannot be above $73k AGI combined. I don't think that makes sense because you are two people, but that is the rule.*

**Q: Does this cover stocks and crypto?**

*A: Yes, all situations should be covered, just make sure to* *READ THE FINE PRINT.*If you live in the UK YSK that the ONS has a calculator that works out what you should be to keep up with the current rate of inflation, and what you pay would be if it were to increase by the current average pay growth.   
  
[Here it is](https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc409/calc/index.html)  
  
   
  
Why YSK: the calculator gives you an indication of the minimum raise you need to cover cost of living at the current rate of inflation. If you get a pay rise of  less than the calculator shows you are essentially getting a pay cut. - be prepared when negotiating salaries. 
  
  
For example  
If you were paid £30k last year, in order to effectively earn the same this year you would need to be paid £31,440 due to inflation any less than this and you’ll have less spending power than you did last year.   
  
However if your pay increases by the average pay growth it would be only £31,260.   
  
  
And of course if you get no pay rise the. You’re being mugged off.Why YSK:

The cost for a prescription in the UK is currently £9.35 per item. If you get prescribed medication regularly you will likely save so much money annually by purchasing a pre-payment certificate. It costs £108.10 for 12 months which can be paid in one go or in 10 monthly direct debit installments.

EDIT: this info is for England only as I have since learnt that Scotland and Wales offer free prescriptions anyway

[Here's where you can purchase one](https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/buy-prescription-prepayment-certificate/start)It's good to check primary sources. Unfortunately many scientific journals have prohibitively high prices for access to articles, making it impossible for most people to access the original write up of the research results. That's why YSK the following trick:

Google Scholar search engine for scientific publications often allows to bypass the paywall. It looks at the journal websites, but also at other websites and preprint servers. Effectively, many publications are accessible for free somewhere else. Sometimes, Google Scholar finds even a direct link to pdf on the publishers website, which bypasses the paywall.

So if you got linked to a scientific journal website, but can't access the publication, copy-paste the title to Google Scholar. There is a decent chance you'll be able to get access to the article there.Why YSK: rather than spending a bunch of money at a bookstore or on amazon, you can send book rentals to a kindle or ereader. I have been reading books this way for years, simply taking advantage of one of my tax paid benefits!

typically you go to your library's website, make an account, then rent the ebook and send it to your amazon account by linking amazon to your library account. Why YSK: In these days of supply line disruptions and resulting shortages, this is an easy way to put some basics back for when you need them. It will also give you a supply in a longer-term emergency.

Food staples such as flour, corn meal, rice, dried lentils, beans, and similar can be preserved in canning jars without the need of pressure canning.

Clean a canning jar thoroughly and let it dry completely. Drying by preheating it in the oven a bit is a handy way of doing it. Fill the jar to the shoulder, you do want to leave a small air gap for expansion during heating, and to prevent contaminating the seal. A funnel makes this part easier.

Making sure the jar rim is clean, place a clean new lid on it with the ring lightly tightened. Then place the jar(s) in your oven at 200 degrees for about 4 hours, and allow them to cool in place once the oven is off.

The lid will seal as the jar cools, keeping the air and moisture out, and the heat will kill off any insect eggs or larvae that may be in the flour, etc. preventing them from hatching or spoiling it. Once the lid has set, you can remove the ring for use on other batches.

Any jar that fails to seal will not draw down the lid, as during cooling a sealed jar creates a small vacuum. (That >tink< sound you'll hear as it cools is the lid popping down from this.) Just replace the lid on a failed seal, make sure the lip is clean and free of small chips, and redo the heating process. It won't hurt the food.

Salt, honey, molasses, and sugar can be stored without the heat process, just make sure to tighten the ring well, and keep it there, as you will not have heated the jar enough to melt the sealant on the jar lid and create a full seal. Of course, if the honey or molasses was already bought in a glass jar, no need for this. Salt in the cardboard carton, sugar in bags, etc. do benefit from it, as those containers don't keep oxygen and moisture out very well. In the case of salt and sugar, you're basically just wanting to keep moisture from caking it up.

I recommend writing the date and ID of the item on the lid with a sharpie, rather than the jar, as it's the lid that isn't reusable.Why YSK: Almost all popular *free* tax return websites usually have **two separate versions** of their filing programs. One appears to be free but will charge you at some point, and one that actually IS free for anyone who's had an adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less.

The one that charges you usually means you have to pay for the state tax return, or if you need to enter anything other than a W2 (for example self employed Schedule C or if you had any rental income Schedule E etc.)

Of course when you google search it's always the paid version that comes up. I'll give you an example:

* ***FreeTaxUSA.com***: Claims to be free for federal returns, and charges you $14.99 for the state tax returns.
* ***FreeTaxUSA.com/FreeFile2021***: Actually free for both federal and state tax returns using the exact same filing software as above. You need to go to this sub-link that cannot be searched for on Google.

How do you find those sub-links? The IRS actually has a page that lists all free to use programs here: **https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/browse-all-offers/**

One more thing: You might need to make a new account if you've used any of the paid programs before. Otherwise it might give you an error saying you cannot use the free version, but a new account will solve this and you can easily import previous years' tax returns if needed.Generally, in the US at least, if you have public water, you still have water pressure and can use the taps and toilet with no problem.  But if it's a well, the pump won't work if the power is out and you don't have a generator.

But if you have water on hand, you can dump water into the tank and flush the regular way, or directly into the bowl and the pressure will force it to flush.  Though it may get higher than you're comfortable with before it does.

 **Why YSK:**  So that you can be prepared in the event of a power outage and not overflow or clog your toilet with waste (that may be hard to flush when the power comes on) or feel the need to go outside in a storm or drive to a public restroom.

I keep three 5 gallon bottles of water in my basement for this use. It's come in handy a couple of times.  I make sure one is fresh enough to use for drinking and cooking.  If it's winter and needed, I know I can always go out and get some snow to melt if I need more.

I figured most people with wells know this, but saw a comment on another post (different sub) where someone mentioned going out in the middle of the night to try to find a public restroom when their power was out.  Also, for those who travel and have always had public water, you may stay in a place with a well and not realize you could do this if the power goes out. Quick story - when I had guests at my camp and the power was out.  They didn't mind that, but couldn't figure out why there was no water. I explained and told them there was a bucket in the closet.  I was thinking to get water from the lake to flush...they thought I meant to use as a commode.  Fortunately I explained before they used it that way.Why YSK:  everyone can hear your email dings during Zoom meetings and they are disruptive and annoying.  You can turn off the sound notification in your email settings.  Your colleagues will appreciate it.Why YSK: cutting off an ambulance results in slower transportation for patients, a strong percentage of ambulance accidents, and adds stress to an already stressed, likely underslept care giver’s job. 

Lights and sirens also go off on on and off ramps, and at fully blocked intersections (so people don’t get nervous and proceed into opposing traffic). 

Also: public perception is that CPR is often successful and results in a full recovery for the patient, but the actual percentages on that are much lower than you might think (can’t seem to find some good data if anyone else would like to add). Often, responders who have seen the results of “successful” cpr go out and get themselves a DNR (do not resuscitate) even at a young age because of the resulting neurological deficits. 

What other misconceptions does the public have about EMS that you wish there could be a PSA about?Why YSK: As a parent YSK because your young adult is likely to have formed a great sentimental attachment to their possessions. They may also have a value you don't realize, e.g. comic books becoming collectors items. It's also hard for a young person to take stuff with them without a car. Ask before junking possessions.

As a child: It's important to communicate with your parents what needs keeping and perhaps giving or throwing away what you no longer need. If you have an unreasonable parent consider posting things to your new address or arranging to return quickly to collect your belongings.Why YSK: so so many videos I see use [this](https://i.imgur.com/XlGNfzx.jpg) fake brand of tomatoes that intentionally mislead you into thinking they are grown in Italy, specifically the San Marzano region. Just so you know, these are just ordinary roma tomatoes grown in the US and canned in the same style as SM tomatoes. 

If you want to use authentic SM tomatoes in your recipes, you need to make sure the can has a “D.O.P” written on the label somewhere, like [this](https://i.imgur.com/sm14Pgz.jpg). It stands for Denomination of Protected Origin and ALL authentic tomatoes exported from San Marzano region of Italy will have this on the label. 

If you can’t find it, at least make sure it says ~~“Made in Italy”~~ “Product of Italy” (if that’s what you’re going for in your recipe).

And if you are reading this and don’t already know, SM tomatoes are famous because the region they are originally grown in has the perfect climate, and volcanic soil that gives them a better flavor. There is a variety of SM tomatoes that can be grown anywhere, but it’s the region and soil that makes them special.Why YSK: This applies to many disabilities, but I've noticed a lot of misconceptions with blindness in particular. People who are considered blind rarely have zero remaining light/shape perception (best I can find is 10-15%). Many of us have some amount of vision depending on the type of condition. For example, I am considered deafblind because I have about 20% of my visual field remaining, poor acuity, no night vision, and severe hearing loss. I still walk down the street just the same as everyone else, I just can't see in the dark or around my periphery (I run into things a LOT) or hear very well.

There are of course many people that lie about these things, but please put your energy towards helping advocate for folks with real disabilities.

I work at one of the biggest National used car dealerships in the US as a mechanic refurbishing used cars. Often enough I receive work orders to remove aftermarket GPS trackers and those vehicles disproportionately have been bought from rental car companies or local independent dealerships.

The GPS trackers only require a switched 12V source for power and use an internal battery for when the vehicle is turned off.

Most common locations, in my experience, are under the driverside dash around the steering column or OBD connector and behind the driverside kick panel, where you usually rest your left foot, it is also common to be installed in the engine bay in vicinity of the battery.

Edit: I should mention that most of these GPS trackers are probably deactivated and no longer actively tracking the vehicles location, regardless, I feel like you all should know that it could be installed and should be removed if it is.Why YSK: Most cars come with a short handled wrench or a shitty cross one with different fittings on each end and a terrible twist jack that you need to place exactly right and can cause knuckle damage against the road whilst twisting especially in bad weather!

If you invest in a socket that fits your wheel nuts and a long handle, it makes the job of removing the nuts effortless... Also a pump hydraulic jack can be bought for very little money these days saving a lot of effort and your knuckles against the road.

Also practice taking off the wheel and replacing it while you car is in your driveway. Don't let your first time be on a road with a flat tyre.Why YSK:

For example, TurboTax Premiere is listed for $90 on their official website, but it's only $54.99 on Amazon. Don't fall for those emails claiming $10 off and the 'guaranteed best price of the year.'

I thought the same, until I was drugged and raped and my rapist bragged about using Quaaludes.

In fact, when I last checked a year ago, they are readily available for cheap on a popular darknet market.

You should also know that marijuana is easily laced with Quaaludes and you may not have a clue you've been drugged until you wake up.

Why YSK: For your personal safety.Why ysk: 

With the opioid epidemic ever increasing the proper procedures for using naloxone (narcan) should be known. If you come across someone who has overdosed and you have narcan, tilt their head back and insert nozzle into their nose. Give it a spray, by placing your fingers in between nozzle and push down. Then proceed to lie them into the recovery position, on their left side with their right arm supporting the head. Using narcan can send the person into withdraws, which can involve vomiting. Call emergency services immediately. It is a fast acting drug, but doesn’t stay long. Sometimes the intranasal dose may not even work and they will need an IV with naloxone. If it doesn’t work, give basic life support, such as CPR or rescue breaths. If you’re in the United States you have a Good Samaritan laws to protect you.

Be carefulDTD is the lifelong inability to orient in extremely familiar surroundings, despite the absence of any acquired brain damage or neurological disorder.

> Individuals affected by DTD are unable to generate a mental representation of the environment (i.e. a cognitive map) and therefore unable to make use of it while orienting (a process that usually people go through while orienting).

Most people don't soul-search about "can I form mental maps?", though.

So it can seem to consist of being guaranteed to get lost, no matter what you do or try...including in places where people shouldn't be *able* to get lost. Because they're covered under even the most basic functional mental map.

> **Not to be confused with healthy individuals who have a poor sense of direction, individuals affected by DTD get lost in very familiar surroundings, such as their house or neighborhood, daily.**

In-depth, from [Frontiers In Psychology](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.654071/full#:~:text=Developmental%20topographical%20disorientation%20\(DTD\)%20has,congenital%20or%20acquired%20brain%20damage.):

> Developmental topographical disorientation (DTD) has been defined as a developmental deficit in human navigational skills in the absence of congenital or acquired brain damage. We report the case of Lost In Space Again (LISA), a 22-year-old woman with a normal development and no clinical history of neurological or psychiatric diseases, evaluated twice, with an interval of 5 years. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination did not reveal any morphological alteration, while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed a structural connectivity deficit (a decreased fractional anisotropy—FA) in the parieto–prefrontal and parieto–premotor pathway. The behavioral assessment showed different deficits in spatial and navigational tasks, which seemed to be connected to a poor ability to form a cognitive map of the environment. Moreover, LISA displayed a poor performance in high-level face encoding and retrieval. The aim of this case report is to share new insight about DTD in order to deepen the knowledge of this specific neurodevelopmental disorder. In conclusion, this novel DTD case (1) supports the hypothesis of the existence of different DTD subtypes; (2) sustains the evidence that DTD can co-occur (or not) with deficit in face recognition; and (3) highlights the need for an in-depth examination from both a neurocognitive and behavioral point of view of a possible common developmental defect between the formation of cognitive maps and the recognition of faces that might be in mental imagery skills. Future directions will be also discussed.

But people don't generally even know about this form of learning disability. They just look down on it. [The most recent topic on the online forum about this is "Relationship strain due to DTD".](https://forum.gettinglost.ca/category/12/general-discussion)

- Nobody brings it up when the first class you fail is "geography", repeatedly, even if the rest of your classes are high As.

- Nobody defends you with it when people look at you like an idiot for not being able to give directions in your own town.

- Nobody even includes it on all those crunchy pop culture infographics about invisible disabilities and "not being a dick to people about medical problems they never asked for".

- I've personally never seen a single other person mention it in unrelated conversation. Even in this age of increased awareness towards invisible disabilities. You just occasionally get back "oh yeah, me too! it's so embarrassing".

Even the very research about it comments on how under-studied and underreported this issue is. Despite that, researchers in Canada have estimated prevalence at 2% of the population - although [the source for that is sketchy at best.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10231323/Are-lost-direction-dyslexia-experts-think-retrain-brain.html)

--------------------------

**Why YSK:** It can be life-altering for someone with DTD to suddenly understand that you are not stupid, you are not lazy, you are not just "addicted to GPS (because technology is Bad)", or "not trying hard enough". And why.

DTD's not actually considered a form of dyslexia (they're separate), but it's not hard to see why and how "directional dyslexia" popped up as a common misnomer.

And nobody has any solution so far. [Aside from experimental solutions, in their infancy, that're still only being tested on people who *can* navigate](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10231323/Are-lost-direction-dyslexia-experts-think-retrain-brain.html)...and just seem like a glorified version of "what about learning to navigate in a videogame?"

So people with DTD really need to swap tips about how everyone's learned to compensate. 

And people without DTD should know that it can be unintentionally cruel to mock folks for being terminally shitty with directions.

(And game designers/devs need to know why some people would kiss you directly on the mouth for including that tiny feature to teleport back home safely after getting lost on the map. Doesn't matter whether it's an AAA open-world fantasy RPG, or a mobile app goat simulator.)

Take these three steps. 

Step one; 
A lot of phishing emails recently are great on the initial open. 'The first look' shall we say. Take your time to read through it and check the information. If the email asks for your details and/or needing to provide any info to the email address. It's probably a scam. Red flag number one. Companies do not want your details especially financial details over emails. 

Step two;
Check the email address. From the sender. What does it read after the @ sign? This is a fantastic indicator to see who is behind the email. If its something ludicrous like @eusehshyewth1747 (just a random example) then it's spam. If its a legitimate business like @bestbuy (or something similar) then it will be legit. 

Step three;
Check back on previous emails received from the potential company. Have you received emails like this before? Look at authentic emails from the company and cross examine them with emails you know are real for sure. 

This is not a 100% fool proof strategy by all means. It's a simple guide to help you pull out the bad emails collecting details and reporting them. 

Optional Step; 
If you're like me and hate the people behind these phishing emails. Then forward them on the company they are pretending to be from. Most companies now (big ones) have a technical team that deal with these emails and would love to hear from you! As they are also being hurt by these fraudsters pretending to be them. 

TLDR three steps to avoid being email scammed. Take your time to read the email. Companies don't ask for your details. Where did the email come from? Check the email address. Finally Check previous emails from the company, do they match up?Why YSK -  a recent YSK post told us how great ammonia is at cleaning. Ammonia is a good chemical for cleaning and bleach is a good disinfectant, [mixing them can be fatal.](https://housewifehowtos.com/clean/cleaning-products-you-should-never-mix/) Many domestic engineers have found this out the hard way.Why YSK: I'm not a lawyer but my wife is and almost everyday she tells me about people who were told by a spouse, friend, family member that it was okay for them to come by the house even though there was an injunction in place and now they are in jail. Jail is bad.

It's not up to them. It's up to the judge. The order is from the judge and THEY are the only people that can remove it. It doesn't matter if you have permission, or you were helping them or whatever, if a judge didn't remove it then you will be arrested and face punishment for disregarding the judge's order. Judges don't like to be disregarded.

Don't reply to texts from someone that has an injection against you even if they are nice.

Also FWIW people can't really "press or drop charges". Prosecutors drop charges. Usually if a victim/witness won't cooperate then Prosecutors will drop the charge but the decision is theirs alone. If there is evidence (like bloody photos and a hospital visit) in addition to the witness then sometimes the witness wanting to press/drop charges or not is completely irrelevant.

TLDR: Why YSK is because you will go to jail if you disregard a judges orders.

For oven grates, place them in a ziplock baggy with a couple of tablespoons of ammonia and let it sit overnight. The vapor loosens the burnt grime. 

For pots, do a basic wash to get out the thickest burnt material. Pour in enough ammonia into the pot to cover the burn and put on the lid. Let it soak overnight and the stain wipes away. 

If the pot is big enough you can kill two birds with one stone by placing the grates in the pot.**Why YSK:** These foods are common in popular media or are "traditional" to feed to stray/wild animals, but they are actually extremely harmful to the animals' health or environment. Consider the normal diet of the animal when determining what food in your house you can share! Links to sources at the bottom.

**Ducks** \-   
Stop feeding them: Bread, bread crumbs, stale bread.  
Why: A diet high in carbohydrates causes stress on duck's bodies, can cause obesity, and causes them to defecate more, which results in spreading of harmful bacteria into ponds and to other ducks and even humans.  
Feed them instead: Frozen (but thawed) peas, corn, grapes (cut them in half or skin them to prevent issues with swallowing/choking)

**Birds -**  
Stop feeding them: crackers, french fries, chips, and bread  
Why: Same reason as above, high carb diets are bad for birds and make them poop too much which spreads diseases and bacteria  
Feed them instead: Seeds, birdseed, chickpeas, berries, dried fruit  
*A note about birds: If you're feeding crows or other corvids, they are omnivores and some raw chicken or pork will very quickly make you some friends.* 

**Rabbits -**   
Stop feeding them: Carrots  
Why: Rabbits don't actually eat fruits or vegetables in the wild, and such foods are far too high in sugar (especially carrots). This can cause upset stomachs, tooth rot, and yes, more bad poop!  
Feed them instead: Dark leafy greens (spinach/kale), cut grass, roses or other non-toxic flowers

**Cats -**   
Stop feeding them: Milk  
Why: Cow milk is NOT a substitute for a mother's milk for kittens. If you feed a stray kitten cow's milk, they will not gain enough nutrients and they will die of malnutrition. **Adult cats are lactose intolerant**. Just like some humans, they cannot digest dairy, and it will give them diarrhea. Yes, it's all about poop here today.  
Feed them instead: Liver or organ meat, egg (microwave until the whites are mostly cooked and the yolk is raw), fish (canned salmon or tuna is fine)  
*A note about cats: Cats are obligate carnivores and require special nutrients such as taurine that can only be found in organ meat or in commercially produced cat food. The above food is fine for a one time situation, or if it's too late and you can't get to the pet store. It is not a long term feeding option if you have just rescued a stray or if you have a stray/outdoor cat that comes around regularly.* ***If you have rescued a kitten too young to eat solid food and can't get to a pet store, go to an emergency vet hospital and they can give you kitten formula for feedings.***

Note: I am not interested in debating the ethics of feeding wild animals, that isn't the purpose of this post. People are going to feed animals regardless of if they should, but they can at least be more ecological and animal-friendly in the way they go about it.

Obviously this doesn’t apply to anything your doctor prescribes you but something you buy from a dealer that comes in a powder or pill form like cocaine, heroin, Xanax, Percocet, ketamine, ecstasy, etc…

When it’s made, there are 2-3 main components. Main ingredient, cutting materials, and binding agent for pills. 

The main ingredient will be whatever you expect to be in it, like alprazolam, an opiate, mdma, etc. this could be got from an actual prescription, or made by some random guy in a lab somewhere.

The binding agent is in anything that is a pill. This is fine, and generally not a huge deal.

Now the big issue is the cutting material. There are two types of this. A filler, like isotol or baby laxities or something along those lines that takes up space and adds weight. Now here is where the big issue is. By adding weight, it would make the substance weaker. Now they have to add something to make it stronger, something cheap but very effective. This is generally fentanyl or meth. Both are very dangerous.

Now the person will take this mixture and stir it up and make it into a pill or powder to distribute.

Here’s the thing, this is generally some dude in his garage. Probably does not have a masters in chemistry or any reason to be qualified to make these pills. He could have been feeling sore today and not stirred it very well or some fentanyl got stuck to the side or added too much or whatever else. This means that one pill could have waaayyyy too much of a cutting agent like fentanyl. It could be your first time taking this drug or you could have been taking it every day and have a high tolerance, but one pill or line could still be all it takes to kill you. There was a myth about fentanyl being able to kill you if it touches your skin. That is not nescessarily true, but it comes from somewhere. That place is the fact that it is incredibly potent and only takes a tiny bit to kill you, no matter who you are.

It is obviously ideal to not do anything not prescribed to you, but if you are going to anyways you can buy test kits in a lot of places. I believe they are about $10 on Amazon. Always text your drugs and make sure you are taking what you think you are. You can also get nalaxone for free at many pharmacies. This can save lives in an opioid(such as fentanyl) overdose situation.

Why Ysk: Fentanyl recently became the leading cause of death for Americans 18-45 and many people don’t realize how likely it is that they have done it. It is very dangerous and a single pill can contain more of it than intended by whoever cut it.

Tldr: the people that cut this stuff are not professionals and way too much cutting agent like fentanyl can be in one pill, enough to kill any person no matter tolerance or size

Source: involved with people that did this for a while, fortunately no longerWhy YSK: A lot of people seem to have trouble with weed making them too paranoid, that's why you should know choosing strains with high CBD or supplementing your high with CBD oil can help take the edge off. 

When weed is growing the later you harvest the less THC it has and the more CBD, this can produce a more relaxing "couchlock" effect which i love personally but haven't had in years. 

This is because most growers nowadays are after higher yields and stronger highs, so they harvest early to maximize THC and minimize growing times, which creates a high that gets you "more stupid" instead of relaxed.

Some seed shops even consider high CBD strains to be their most medicinal!

Try it for yourself and see what works, baby steps are key here to get the dosimg just right for both your THC and CBD.

TL;DR:

Try a high CBD strain or some CBD oil to take the edge off your weed high!


Edit:

Currently not able to get high from taking too much CBDWhy YSK: Very useful when using the device single handed. From am accessibility stand point for larger device etc.Why YSK: If (like me) you’re only staying with Spotify because you’ve built up a lot of personal playlists with them, apps (like SongShift) will copy and sync your playlists over to other music streaming services.  This makes it easy to try other services, many of which offer free trials.Why YSK:

There seems to be a lot misconception about renting being much more expensive than home ownership, and bank's not giving out mortgages that have lower monthly payments than a person's current rent being an unfair system. 

1. If the buyer is un able to finance a large down payment to buy the house, they are a high risk for the lender. It is best to have a 20% down payment at the time of purchase for better rates and no added cost of mortgage insurance. Most lender's require a minimum of 5% down, but still take a careful look into the buyer's income and current net worth to determine if they are qualified take out a loan. 
2. Appraisal gaps: You can only borrow what the home is appraised at, so seller's will prioritize offers with appraisal gaps, most of which are in the 5 digit range. These gaps are an upfront cost from the buyer and not part of the 5-20% down payment or monthly mortgage payment. It is essentially a cash-payment to the seller in addition to what you lend from your banker.
3. Upkeep and repairs. No home is repair-free, and those repairs can be surprisingly expensive to new home owners. Buyer's should do research for average repair costs in the their area for typical maintenance items in a home. Lender's know this as well, and know that a buyer would prioritize getting something like their HVAC system replaced over paying this month's mortgage if it came to that choice, and the lender does not want this risk. 

* Let me speak from experience here. I had a reputable inspector check my duplex prior to purchase, nothing surprising came up. A couple months went by and my basement flooded. After clean-up this kept happening with every rain, getting worse and worse each time. There are a couple ways to fix this, but only one will work for the lifetime of the house. Pause here and guess how much is costs to install a sump pump and French drain into a home currently.  ->$14500. Might be an extreme case, but a buyer needs to be ready for outlandish repairs. It is not a Honda Civic, it is a $350,000+ structure. 

Things to consider: The 26% comes from the 2021 median U.S. home price of $375,000 and average 2-bedroom house/apartment/condo rent of $1,900. A $375k mortgage with perfect credit, 5% down, no appraisal gap, 3.5% interest rate, 1.5% property tax rate, $232/mo mortgage insurance rate. and a $109/mo home insurance rate leaves the buyer with a $2,410/mo mortgage. The gap is large in an overall average, but will vary by city. It is more common to find a 3-bedroom home than a 3-bedroom apartment if that is a requirement for you. However, single-family rentals are generally still less per month compared to a mortgage on that same property. 

Home ownership's biggest advantage is that part of your mortgage payment is an investment. Ideally when you go to sell your house, you sell it at a higher price. The monthly payment you make goes directly into that and becomes an appreciated cash value. This is completely stripped away with rent. However, you need to make sure you're ready to own a home and tough it out through the unavoidable repairs and upkeep. I don't think it is a right to own a home, but it is an attainable goal more most to have one. There is not a good age to buy your first home, but instead many factors to determine when is the right time to do so. Buy reasonably!In this day and age, there's no good reason that you should have to view digital advertisements. Why YSK: this guide will save you time by teaching you, if you don't know already, how to efficiently block ads.

Ads:

* Are annoying
* Take up unnecessary resources such as bandwidth (you can block well over 10,000,000 ads in a matter of maybe a couple years)
* Can be vectors for malicious software (malvertising)
* Are ways for large companies to convince you to buy something (generally subconsciously and generally something that you don't need)
* Waste your time

As an ancillary note, this guide will also help you avoid sponsored segments, which often advertise crappy, overpriced garbage (e.g. [Manscaped](https://np.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/l6d5ym/manscaped_baited_me/), [Raycons](https://np.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/mbuvhp/poor_raycon_earbud_sound_quality/)) and waste your time by forcing you to sit through them or manually scrub past.

Here's a simple, practical guide to avoiding both of them.

Please, don't be that person you can smell of Chanel's finest from across the room. I like perfume as much as the next person, it's good to smell nice, but perfume is extremely potent and it's a case of less is more. It's also an acquired taste, not everyone wants to smell it, especially when it's strong, so go easy when you spray.

Most importantly, do not bother wearing cologne if you think it's a shower in a bottle. It is not. There is no point in wearing it to mask bad smells, and if anything, it just pronounces the unpleasant stink. It is more important to not smell bad than to smell nice. There is a difference. Cologne should be used as a final touch, once you have completed the whole nine yards of personal hygiene. Washing your body, clean clothes, clean hair, oral hygiene.**Why YSK**: So, whenever you have more income than last year, you can fully appreciate it, not be discouraged that you were "bumped into the next tax bracket."

Because it's a bracket system, you're only paying a higher rate on that *additional* level of income. The rest of your income stays at the same tax rate as last year.

An example for a single person....

* In 2020, you're in technical school and not working much. Your taxable income was only $9.9k. It was taxed at 10%.
* You graduated; and, for 2021, your taxable income is now $40.5k. The first $9.9k is *still* taxed at 10%.
* Only the amount *over* $9.9k is taxed at the next highest rate (12%).
* Even if you started making $100k in 2022, the first $9.9k is *still* taxed at 10%, and the next level up to $40.5k is *still* taxed at 12%.

*(Also, why YSK: So you don't annoy your CPA friends, such as me, every time you mention such a worry, and I end up needing to correct you)*Why YSK:

There are several factors that can influence your bodyweight including water retention, recent bowel movements (or lack thereof), menstruation cycle, medications you're taking, and more. 

If you're going to track your bodyweight, it's important to weigh yourself at a consistent time of day such as in the morning before eating, and to do it on a regular basis, such as every Sunday. If you decide to weigh yourself everyday, your weight can fluctuate and therefore it's more important to track trends instead of focusing on each day's specific number. Personally, whenever I'm trying to lose weight, I use the app Libra: you can add your weight everyday and the app automatically calculates trends in your weight loss or gain based on consistent changes.

Just because the scale hasn't tipped in your favor for one day isn't a reason to become discouraged! However, if you're noticing that trends aren't going well over the course of several days or weeks, you will likely have to make some changes in your diet and/or exercise regimen.

[Source](https://www.healthline.com/health/weight-fluctuation#when-to-weigh)

Edit: It seems like there's a lot of people who argue whether to weigh yourself daily, weekly, or even less frequently. While weighing yourself daily will give you the most accurate data to determine the trend of your weight change, ultimately it's your decision to do what feels right and comfortable for you.Why YSK:

All American cars made after 2002 are required to have a trunk release inside the trunk, thanks to a national law. ... It will usually be a glow-in-the-dark handle located near the trunk latch, but it may also be a cord, button, or toggle switch, or a handle that does not glow in the dark.

I was just watching a true crime episode and the woman did not know there was a trunk release in her car that could’ve potentially saved her life.Why YSK: Throwing away moldy hard/semi-soft cheeses (e.g. Cheddar, Colby, Parmesan, Swiss) is wasteful since the mold is unable to penetrate deep into the cheese.

One of the examples is in digital marketing. There is a service that is often called "remarketing". Google ads and other platforms offer such services that allow showing ads to people that had already seen some kind of product, an ad, or a website before. This technique is often highly effective. 

**Are there scientific studies behind it?**

In one study, over 200 participants had to watch 40 ideographs (drawn characters from a foreign Language), quickly flashing on the computer screen. 

Some ideographs were shown many times while others only once. 

Then participants were allowed to look at the ideographs and rate how familiar they look and how much they like them. 

**The results:** 

People rated familiar ideographs over 15 percent more positively compared to the ones that they rated as not familiar.

[Here](https://cognisera.com/familiarity-effect/) you can find other studies that look into the familiarity effect if you are interested. It happens with prices as well. Some studies show that people tend to pay more for things that are familiar. 

**Why YSK:** 

It's good to be aware of what advertising techniques are being used to make you buy something. Perhaps you looked at some product that you don't even need too much and didn't buy it. Now you are browsing some other, completely unrelated website and an ad appear for that item. If you're not very tech-savvy, you might think that it might be some coincidence, it's not. Now you know why.Why YSK: One tablespoon is 15 grams of powder or 15 milliliters of liquid. One teaspoon is equal to 5 grams of powder or 5 milliliters of liquid. So if you're cooking a meal for one person and the recipe says it serves three, an easy way to cut the ingredients down to a third is simply to use a teaspoon of an ingredient when it asks for a tablespoon.Why YSK: Becuase if you have a safe with Chase, you will be affected if you haven't been notified

I only found out after looking at the cost of a safety deposit box with Chase and a Reddit search indicated some users have been notified. Second, if you haven't been notified and you are reading this. It's probably time to check. I could write this post about it being a generic check your bank for updated information on safety deposit boxes. This is specific and if the information is internal to a bank's operation, few will learn of the changes if it's not publicized.

This was a very (intentionally) drawn-out process wherein you were asked what was wrong, why you wanted to cancel, offered a less-expensive plan, asked about that plan, offered an even less-expensive plan ($5/month is the "bottom-tier", if you will), and essentially kept on the phone as long as possible. The service rep on the other end was obviously working through a very strict script. Over this whole process you were also put on hold repeatedly.

I have been on the phone for over an hour nearly every time I went through this. I know they have a job to do, and I respect that, I was always polite to them, but I do not want to be on the phone that long for something like this. Also, wherever SXM has their call center, for the life of me I can barely understand them through their accents.

I had to cancel my service yesterday, at least for now. The app gave me the option to use chat. It took me twelve minutes.Have you ever stood on a balcony, leaned over the edge and unexpectedly thought, "If I wanted to, I could just jump?" Or perhaps you've been at a cliff's edge, with the intention of doing nothing more than enjoying the view and fleetingly considered how easy it would be to simply step over the edge. This sudden, often unanticipated thought is usually nothing to be worried about

Why YSK This feeling — which tends to be brief, entirely out of character and often involves thoughts of leaping from a high place or driving headfirst into an oncoming vehicle — is more widespread than you might think. In fact, it's so common, the French have a term for it: l'appel du vide. In English, this translates to "the call of the void."

Why YSK: A lot of companies claim to offer free filing but still have a cost or it's very difficult to find the true Free File option and they con you into paying anyhow (*looking at you, TurboTax and H&R Block*). Sometimes they charge $50-$100 or more.

By using the IRS search above, you can find a truly free way to file your taxes as long as you meet the maximum income requirements, which I believe many redditors will meet. Many of them (including the one I use, OnLine Taxes), will also file your state tax return for free as well.

Be sure to use the link found through the IRS website; going through the company's website directly will not necessarily result in a free return. I'm mentioning [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/sdrkdh/ysk_the_random_urge_you_get_to_drive_into_a/) YSK. We can experience a wide variety of brain paradoxes, where an information and reasoning we do unconciously all the time contradict each other, and our brain absolutely cannot deal with paraodxes like that, and will do anything it can to stop it. And most of the time, it will hallucinate something to make it go away.

For example, deja vu. Yes, another french thing, go figure. We sometimes have the feeling of having experienced the same thing before, even in brand new situations where that can't be true. It's because our eyes send 2 images to the brain, which are expertly melded into one image that is the reality we experience 99.9999% of the time. BUT, on rare occasions, this mechanic will fail for a few seconds, sending the brain 2 seperate images at the same time. The brain suddenly has 2 realities presented to it, but can only deal with one. Paradox. It has only one recourse, hallucinate a scenario in which it can happen to have 2 images coming to the brain at the same time. When we are reminescing a memory. The brain convinces itself that this is a memory from the past, even though it's happening right now.

In the case of l'appel du vide, it's specific to people. you either have it or you don't, and it has to do with the amygdala, which controls fear. For a person who doesn't suffer from vertigo, when looking down a high building or something, your amygdala sends a signal to your brain that this is a dangerous situation. If you fall, you die. But since you won't fall without a good reason, the fear is controlled and nothing happens.   
In people who *do* have vertigo, that amygdala signal does not shut off. It keeps firing fear signals. Your brain has reasoned that the danger is not immediate, but the amygdala keeps saying that it is. Paradox. So your brain hallucinates a reason : Someone is about to push you off, the void is goingto pull you in, a sudden gust of wind will make you trip.

Why YSK: I dont want people thinking something is wrong with them. Well, technically it is something going wrong in your brain, but it's normal.

[The Science Behind The 'Call Of The Void' | Endless Thread (wbur.org)](https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread/2018/06/29/the-call-of-the-void)Why YSK:  I rented a Penske truck and drove through tolls.  I was charged for the $20 in tolls and then also for a $25 "administrative fee for Penske's cost incurred in resolving this matter".  I received a letter explaining this with a number to call.  I called and in the first 5 seconds of me just bringing up the extra fee and asking for clarification the rep immediately suggested she would refund the admin fee.  It's clear they are just charging this and betting that most people won't call.  Shady corporate greed.I learned about this the other day thought I’d share. PayPal offers free return shipping if you pay with PayPal and have to pay for a return. I believe it’s up to $30, 15 times a year or something. You have to activate the service first. Then once you have a return, go to your shipping carrier and ship it and take a pic of receipt. Go to your PayPal, click the payment and then click “get return shipping on us.” Then upload pic of receipt. PayPal will reimburse you. Done! 

Why YSK: I just did this successfully the other day and received $15 on return shipping.Why YSK:

I'm currently navigating a credit card chargeback and dispute with a merchant and from reading the chargeback guide they broadly break down into:

* Was the charge authorized (i.e. did you give your card for that amount)?
* Did the merchant follow the rules regarding processing credit card payments?
* Did the merchant properly provide goods/services as described?

Almost all chargeback reason codes fall into one of these categories and strictly deal with the mechanics of processing the payment.

If the payment was authorized you are basically out of luck with a chargeback and must go to the courts instead, even there if you authorized the charges then it's going to be an uphill battle. Deception, fraud, or verbal disputes is not something well handled by the system.

If there is a dispute over the charges you can give your contact information instead and request for a mailed copy of the bill. This can be particularly difficult in situations like Taxis, Restaurants, and other service professions where immediate payment is expected. But you should stand firm and do not authorize charges that you don't completely agree with. In pretty much all cases if you leave your contact info and come back later you will be fine.

If only part of the payment is authorized I would recommend sending them written communication that reflects that fact.Why YSK: I am a professional pharmacovigilance case processor and reports like this could really prove to be useful in times like these and could actually help the pharmaceutical companies to make their medications more effective.[citation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23603621/)Why YSK: Due to a lag of privacy protection (especially in certain countries), homes have been recorded and placed on various apps, with all accesses shown.

Don't be fooled

Why YSK: things like painkillers and illness relief are a common household item everyone needs, and knowing this will surely save you a fair amount of money in the long run

Edit: I'm definitely not inferring that you shouldn't read labels in case there IS a difference in the ingredients such as a potential allergen when there isn't normally, stay safe and read them always but save yourself some cash money when possibleWhy YSK: So you don’t stress about where to put 3 cartons of eggs just so you could get that savings.

For example it’ll say a carton of eggs is 2.99 each *but* you can get 3 for 4.99 with the store account. In fine print it will say 1.66 each. Which is what the actual price is for a *single* carton. You don’t need to buy 3. 

It’s very misleading and should be illegal in my opinion....and a low faucet, then you know how life changing it can be to have a really nice high pressure elevated faucet and a deep single kitchen sink.  Not only do you cut rinsing and washing time but you can increase cleanliness and germ management in the kitchen.  You can also prepare meals much more quickly with a large sink and nice faucet.  Its the difference between teetering a package of chicken on the edge of the sink and getting chicken juice all over the place and just tossing that thing in the sink and knowing you have maintained a totally sterile environment.



I had never installed a sink before and I went from a 4.5 inch depth double sink to an open single 9 inch with one of those tall coiled faucets - like what they have in restaurants.  I spent $250 total for the whole set, bought it out of some guy's trunk in a parking lot.  I found him on an online selling site like CraigsList or Offer Up.  I looked up a comparable Kohler setup and it would have been $1500 minimum.


Btw its not hard to install a sink.  Do a little research and give yourself one evening.


The first time I washed a cutting board in the new sink I was like HOLY FUCK what have I been missing out on, and so I thought I would share.


 

Why YSK: Saving money, time, and effort in the kitchen can greatly improve a person's quality of life.Most people simply take for granted that the insides of their ears are symmetrical, but this is often not the case. It's perfectly normal for one ear hole to be larger/smaller than the other!

**Why YSK**: Earbuds come with multiple tip sizes to help you get the best possible fit, but most people don't think to test eartip sizes independently for each ear. If one of your earbuds keep falling out, this can be a sign that you didn't pick the most optimal eartip size on that side.

Some additional information:

* Earbuds *do* fall out for other reasons, too. For example: even well-fitted earbuds can fall out during exercise (*though ill-fitting earbuds will definitely worsen that issue*)
* Sizing issues can go in both directions (too small OR too large), don't just assume that the eartip is too small if it doesn't fit! The best way to find out is by experimenting (*please don't do anything that hurts, though!*)
* If you can't seem to find the right fit, consider buying aftermarket eartips. You can often buy sample packs that come with a pair in each size -- these sample packs are great for people with asymmetrical ear canals, because you effectively get two usable pairs of eartips instead of just one.

I was surprised to find that this isn't a very well studied phenomenon! Among audio enthusiasts, it's generally thought that that this kind of thing happens fairly often (to the point where Shure specifically talks about the issue in [a support article](https://service.shure.com/s/article/earphones-do-not-fit-are-uncomfortable-or-will-not-stay-secure-in-my-ear-canal?language=en_US)), but it does not seem as though anyone has done a proper study to see how prevelant such asymmetries actually are.

There *is*, however, a study (Oliveira, R., Babcock, M., Venem, M., Hoeker, G., Parish, B., & Kolpe, V., 2005) related to how ear volume changes with jaw movement that could be extrapolated to suggest that at least 1/3 individuals have some significant level of asymmetry (n=67).

- Your old work contract may include a non disclosure agreement and those are typically binding indefinitely. So your previous employer may be able to sue you if they by chance read the post. 
- If you spill secrets about a company's customer service policies or other topics that people could take advantage of, that can be viewed as soliciting fraud and can bring you into trouble as well. 
- You make the life harder for all your previous coworkers. Even if you didn't like the job, you probably still liked some of the coworkers. 
- Depending on the position you are aspiring to, potential future employers may check an applicants social media accounts even before inviting you to a job interview. If they see that you could not keep your mouth shut about your previous employers then they will assume you may do the same to them one day and probably decide to not even invite you to an interview.Why YSK: Committed suicide gives a negative connotation, and perpetuates stigma surrounding suicide loss. When communicating with the survivors after suicide (SAS) population, the best practice is to use phrases such as “died by suicide,” “loss to suicide,” or even a verb such as “this person suicided” (less common). This has been on my mind for a while, and I never see anyone use this phrasing when discussing suicide loss. 

Note: obviously an individual can use any phrase they are comfortable with, but ultimately words have power, and in order to lessen the stigma we should be cognizant of how we use these phrases. I am not trying to police anything just trying to spread information to lessen stigma.Why YSK: All kinds of people sound different especially over the phone, some perfectly straight men have a higher voice and some perfectly straight women have low voices as well as every other possibility in between. To avoid awkward exchanges or out right disrespecting the person on the other end of the phone its only fair to refer to them with gender neutral terms!Why YSK: I know there's been a spike in the amount of [news stories featuring people being tracked](https://weartv.com/news/local/pace-woman-believes-stranger-used-apple-airtag-to-track-her) for nefarious purposes by sticking apple air tags to their vehicles and other places. If you have an iPhone, it'll alert you to the presence of these tags automatically. However, if you have an android phone, it will not automatically alert you.

I read up on this trend and apparently [apple has released an official app that can detect air tags and other similar tracking devices.](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/android-users-get-this-apple-app-if-you-dont-want-airtags-tracking-you/) This makes it so now even Android users can be sure they're not being tracked by these devices!

Edit: [Here's the Google play store link for the app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect&hl=en_US&gl=US)**Why YSK:** A little bit of problem solving and self-management can really go a long way towards building a better relationship with your partner. It can be mentally stressful and frustrating for people to manage household chores alone. So often, when they're asking for help, what they're actually asking for is the freedom not to worry that something won't get done.

If you're asking questions about where to put things or find things or how and when to do things that adults should generally know how to do (or can easily look up online), you haven't actually removed any of the mental stress of that task. Whomever you're helping will still feel like they're going through the steps of the chore mentally even if they aren't physically doing it and that still leads to stress and mental energy spent on that activity.

On the flip side, if you find your partner relies too heavily on you to outline steps for them, try making lists and labeling items. Writing down what you do as an easily accessible reference can provide you both with a quick, easy way to answer questions. You can even take some time to do the chores and tasks with them so that it's understood and expected that they'll be asking questions and that you'll be involved in the process. Changing the context and expectations can really help with feeling of frustration and annoyance.

This can also apply to roommates, family, friends, colleagues, etc. Basically any relationship where chores or tasks can be shared and have become a source of stress or friction.Why YSK: sometimes it’s never confirmed it was staged and most people believe what they’re seeing in a video, that we have no context of whatsoever.Why YSK: because two mediums is typically more expensive and more crust.

It’s blowing my mind and my world is upside down.Why YSK: GoodRX and similar programs aren't fixing the current broken drug pricing scheme in the US, rather they are profiting off of it, and in turn propagating it. I work for a retail pharmacy often known to have the best GoodRX prices, and we frequently lose money on prescriptions adjudicated through GoodRx. Why? Because it's in our contract with the PBMs that process these claims that we have to accept these cards when presented with them, and considering the industry of prescription insurance is an oligopoly (Optum, ESI/Medco/Cigna, Prime Therapeutics, CVS Caremark and Argus/DST) refusing or trying to negotiate this out of the contract results in losing money on 15-20% of your insured claims, which often include claims billed through Medicare/Medicaid managed care plans. These companies encourage pharmacies to charge more for their Usual and Customary (U&C) for cash paying patients, in turn they look like the saviors when they are used, and they intentionally door a poor job negotiating on high-deductible contracts so you feel obligated to save money by using the plan and not your insurance while you're in the deductible phase. The pharmacies that accept them also rarely profit, unless they themselves own their own PBM (like CVS Caremark). I usually see us making $1 per claim, while GoodRX pockets $7 for essentially doing nothing but advertising for the PBM's discount cards. This is another reason you have seen a giant decline in independent and small chain pharmacies in the last 10 years.Why YSK: Many workers in the service sector [are interested in forming a union](https://gcgj.mit.edu/sites/default/files/imce/resource-uploads/Kochan%20et%20al.%20Worker%20Voice%20Survey%20Paper%20June%202018.pdf) to negotiate higher wages or better benefits. [Unionized workers make 13.2% more money](https://www.epi.org/publication/fear-at-work-how-employers-scare-workers-out-of-unionizing/) than nonunion workers. But [studies have shown](https://www.epi.org/publication/fear-at-work-how-employers-scare-workers-out-of-unionizing/) that many people fear retaliation or punishment. 

The National Labor Relations Act [prohibits employers from firing or retaliating against employees](https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act) who are forming a union.

It's relevant to other industries also.Why YSK: name-brand prescription medications are extremely expensive and unaffordable for a lot of people, fortunately a lot of these medications have a generic brand. 

For example, when I got my wisdom teeth removed I was prescribed 
OxyContin; however, the pharmacy (rite-aid) asked me if I wanted their generic brand medication instead, it was the same dosage and everything. The only thing that was different was that it wasn’t called OxyContin and it wasn’t as expensive. 

If I had gotten OxyContin, it would’ve cost me around $350. The in-store brand cost me like $25

Also, for people that live in Washington state (like me), pharmacies have to inform you about a cheaper alternative to your name-brand prescription, this is a law.**Why YSK:** For the past two years, I've been living with hand tremors that worsen off and on. They sometimes make it difficult for me to do everyday tasks. I've already been diagnosed with a grocery list of psychiatric disorders, but I never thought they might be the cause of my physical trembling. I worried that the trembling may be symptomatic of something worse. While knowing the cause now doesn't fix the immediate issue, it helps me know what steps I can take to reduce tremors and improve my quality of life.

This might seem like a "duh" statement to some, as tremors are typically associated with anxiety. The reason for posting this is because these tremors don't just happen during anxiety/depressive/PTSD/etc. episodes. They're typically ongoing and can happen even when a person is relaxed. Sharing this because it was a huge relief for me to find out that I'm not secretly developing Parkinson's or anything like that.

You also have to sign a consent form allowing Intuit to use your tax information for more than just filing with the IRS.

To avoid this opt to pay with a card instead.

Inevitable Edit:I wanted to share based on my experience. After spending 2+ hours combing through my finances/apps/receipts... brain fog had set in. The way the $44 charge is intentionally placed where it is on the page, isn't advertised as an "additional" fee, how small the font is + fine print in addition to the overly abundant spacing between "Pay with Your Refund" and "Premium Services Benefits" with a slightly off centered "$44"... I genuinely think this is an additional charge that is easily missed/overlooked...and I think whoever was hired to oversee the layout, Web Dev of the this particular page, was instructed to make this additional fee easy to overlook.

\~\* Five Minutes Later \*\~

The fine print:

From TurboTaxes Checkout Page: "Premium Services gives you Audit Defense, Full Identity Restoration, Identity Theft Insurance, and other great benefits, along with the FREE option to pay with your federal refund. Learn more"

After clicking on the "Learn More" link, it seems as though in addition to allowing you to deduct all fees out of your federal refund, you also get Identity Theft Protection and Monitoring for a year.

I don't know if it's a banking institution but more fine print states: "TurboTax®, in partnership with TaxAudit"

"TaxResources, Inc., dba TaxAudit, will provide the audit defense services for the tax return described on the membership certificate in return for the applicable membership fee and compliance with all applicable terms of this agreement (the “Audit Defense Plan”).[https://turbotax.intuit.com/corp/auditdefense-oneyear/](https://turbotax.intuit.com/corp/auditdefense-oneyear/)"

So for what its worth, I just wanted to make others aware to look out for this being  we can all be susceptible to mad-dash clicking through the checkout process a and not realize until after the fact that what we thought would cost $77 winds up being $121 +tax.Why YSK: You can pick the wrong option when comparing price per unit on competing brands / similar items, and lose money in the process.Why YSK: A common question for interviews is "How much are you looking to get paid", and it obviously doesn't mean "how much do you want to get paid". If you answer too little, the interviewer will think you have no idea what the job is about and obviously have no experience, and the company will be all too willing to exploit you and underpay you, if you answer too much, they'll also thing you don't know what you're talking about or that you're overvaluing yourself. Always use experience, any useful but not required skills, qualifications and whatever you can to justify your answer. Try to find how much is the base pay, and if the company in particular has more benefits than most try to lowball it a little, if it has way less highball it. 

For example, you could say "I am looking to get paid around the $100k per year range, considering that i have a marketing degree on top of my engineering one, i have successfully provided services to several reputed companies, improving sales and customer satisfaction, as well as increasing productivity in the office for over 5 years", or something along those lines that is true and applies to your situation. You don't need to guess the exact number, and it's probably not gonna be exactly how much you get paid, but it gives the interviewer an idea of how much you know about the job, the company and how you value yourself.Why YSK: This means that your plumbing is backed up somewhere, either from a blocked pipe or a full septic tank.

I’ve owned my home for about 10 years now, and during that time, I purchased a lot of different appliances and devices. Every now and then, I have an issue with one of them, and I have to try to find the owners manual. At a certain point I realized I could just consolidate everything digitally, so I created a file folder on my computer specifically for PDF versions of owners manuals, then I went and found all the ones that I owned… lawnmower, washer/dryers, TVs, SoundBars, etc. 

It’s saved me a lot of time and energy having everything available in one place for when I need it. This tip is pretty basic, but hopefully it helps somebody.

Why YSK: it helps you stay organized, find troubleshooting resources quicker, and takes up less space… and you can’t lose them.Why YSK: https://www.ajperri.com/blog/clear-furnace-vents-snow-risk-carbon-monoxide-poisoning

Also, there could be a pipe coming out of both sides of your home. Make sure both are clear and double check that your carbon monoxide detectors are workingWhy YSK: In the US nuclear accounts for [20% of current energy generation](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/nuke/IF11201.pdf), with the majority of the plants situated in the eastern portion of the country.  Currently, nuclear waste from plant operations has to be stored on site because there is no means of disposal.Reposted to add the why YSK header.

**NOTE:** This is mainly for first-time property owners & first-time renters, property managers, and landlords who are likely getting inundated with heating complaints this time of year. 

It may seem cost-effective to just put a sweater on (or to ignore your tenants until it gets warmer), but if you live in a climate with big temperature shifts, it's very likely that your property REQUIRES adequate heating as part of regular maintenance. And I don't mean by law. I mean by physics.

**Why you should know/ Why YSK:** Dwellings need to be adequately heated to promote proper moisture evaporation. If it's too cold, water just hangs out and never dries out completely which can lead to rotted out floors, rusty pipes, and mould. It can also rot out insulation, which will in turn lead to even higher heating costs since it'll take more energy to heat the same space.

For those of you like me who are renting and have no control over the heat: keep a log of the daily temperature to protect yourselves if your landlords try to blame you or charge you for repairs due to things like water damage. 

And if you have particularly shitty landlords (again like me), try to store things in dry, safe places away from walls and closet corners. That's where condensation and mould tend to build up and it can ruin your stuff pretty fast--we're talking one or two weeks of bad heating. I lost all my childhood books and stuffed animals because our landlords nickel-and-dimed our heat and told us to "put on a sweater" even when we showed them our sweaty, mouldy walls and I don't wish that experience on anyone else.

Edit: Forgot to included "first time renters" in my note.

Edit 2: For the people talking about relative humidity—you're forgetting that daily living produces a ton of moisture. Taking a shower, cooking, even working out at home can all add moisture to the air. If you've ever taken a shower in a cold house and left your towel to dry, you know that it takes way longer than if it's in a warm place. The same is true of your walls. And when you're producing heat and moisture above and beyond what's happening naturally in your home, you're going to get that condensation on and in your walls as the water falls out of the air and settles on cold surfaces.

Also. If you're trying to JUSTIFY keeping a place cold to me let me stop you: IDGAF if you think it's cheaper and worth it. This post isn't for you. And I hope your tenants sue the shit out of you.Why YSK: Some accountants, document preparers, applications, etc., might offer anyone in the US who owes money to the IRS payment or installment plans. Sometimes these plans may come with significant charges or fees.

YSK that upon learning you owe to the IRS, you can mail your tax return with a statement saying you are aware of the amount you owe, and what you can offer in installments. Up to a few weeks later you will receive an installment plan agreement from the IRS, sometimes for significantly less per month than what you had offered. Each month you would receive a statement regarding what is owed, interest, payment slip, and return envelope. You can still do this even after using tax preparation software.Why YSK: Tax prep software is expensive as hell. In the US, if you make under a certain amount of income ($73k), you legally are entitled to free tax prep software from major companies. You can do your state and federal taxes for free if this applies to you. More information on the IRS’s website here: https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/Why YSK: Shrink-flation occurs when manufacturers and retailers  keep prices the same but give you less product while the consumer is not necessarily aware that they are receiving less product. 

Watch out for slightly redesigned packaging for stuff you normally buy. If the package says "new look" or "new packaging", this could be a tipoff. 

For example, my family buys a particularly brand of hand soap. It cost $2.99 for a 12oz bottle for the last couple of years. Then a few weeks ago, I noticed the bottle was now 11.4oz and the price stayed the same. The "new improved package" was meant to hide the fact that you are receiving less product for your money!I have seen videos of cats getting rescued from Doritos bags, metal cans, glass jars etc. 

Why ysk: Whether you throw your trash in the regular trash or the recycling bin, animals and specifically cats might get hurt by it while looking for food. First of all, if you can, clean with water the remaining food/liquid from your trash. 

Metal cans in particular are dangerous. Not only are they about the same size as a cats head and could get them stuck there with no air but they are also sharp at the top. So try to squash and seal your cans before you throw them. 

Would appreciate if someone chime in on what to do with glass jars. Breaking them might be dangerous too so not sure.**Why YSK**: In your order history for Amazon you can check to see if any e-gift vouchers that you have purchased for other people have been redeemed.

It will say **Sent** if it is unredeemed and say **Received** if it has been used!

It might be good to remind the original recipient that it's there, maybe it's been lost and they didn't feel right telling you.

Definitely better being spent than Amazon having extra cash just sitting there!

I personally had a few unused vouchers for other people that I was able to chase up!Why YSK: They don’t get washed so there’s a big chance that there’s still some dirt/sand/other sharp stuff in them. They’re also not made from high-quality materials. If you want to avoid scratches while washing your car, buy a sponge.
Coming from someone who worked at a car wash for 2 years and had to handle a lot of complaints about scratches after washing.Why YSK - you will get the best and the most of nutrients if you cook anything you forage, hunt or fish in the wild in some water instead of grilling it on the fire, it is also the most efficient way to share equally with someone in case you're not alone.
We often see on surviving shows and movies people putting food directly in the fire or eating it raw, that's the worst way to cook nutritionally efficient for surviving. If you have the choice to cook everything in a pot of water (or whatever container you have available) do it that way, joints in the bones and the skin will break into collagen and that will be more easily and quickly absorbed by your body, organs that are rich in vitamins and minerals will also break up and infuse the broth with nutrition, plants and mushrooms are often more safe and easily digested when cooked in water, and you can always use this method to mush everything evenly so you can share better (it's much more difficult to share a fish or a lizard in two equal pieces when it's roasted). Unripe fruits can be hard to digest and even dangerous to eat when not ripe, cooking them is also the best practice if you find any. Roasted vegetables or meat can get burnt pieces and these burnt bits are just gone calories and nutrition, whatever gets burned is not used by our body and in a survival situation, any calories, carbs and protein are vital. Surely not the tastiest, but definitely the most efficient.Why YSK: many people take outdoor photos in the shade, or with the subject's back toward the sun. This can result in dark photos which lack detail. Using your flash in these situations - known as fill flash - can improve your photos by providing light to things which are in shadow. It's also a good idea to look at your background to make sure you don't have a bright source of light behind your subject - even reflected light, as this can cause a shorter exposure which loses detail, or it can cause undesirable glare on your subject.Why Ysk is because the best way for your tip to go to employees is to leave it in cashAmazon exaggerates the product descriptions (usually uses a template description) of items that have cosmetic imperfections or have been returned and sell them under their Amazon Warehouse seller account. Typically (not always) these are just products that don't include original packaging or have minor cosmetic flaws, yet they are heavily discounted. If Amazon is not the seller then this may not be the case. Expect the worst and hope for the best. You can return the item if it's worse than described. 

Why YSK: You can sometimes get a 10-20% discount on products that have only been returned.While I was taking a nap, my wife received a call from our electric company claiming our service was in imminent danger of being disconnected due to being three months arrears.  Normally I handle all of the bills but due to life getting more hectic I had just transitioned all bills to my wife.  It was at the point they were directing her to download a non-company application to send payment that she twigged to what was going on and hung up.  
Why YSK: It is a continuous arms race between the scammers and their targets.  I’m in a technical field and I’ve educated my family as best I can, but it only takes a momentary lapse, during an already chaotic moment in your life, for you to make a mistake, and it can be very costly.
1) if a company calls demanding immediate action, tell them you’re going to hang up and immediately dial their eight hundred number to resolve it. 
2) never give them any information to confirm anything, they called you they have to prove to you who they are.  
3) fear tactics are their bread and butter, they will keep you off balance and on script, do not be afraid to tell them to hold while you verify their claims.Intuit, the parent company of Turbotax is no longer participating in the Free File Alliance, meaning if you use Turbotax to do your taxes, it's not going to be free this year.

Why YSK, when it comes to Americans and doing their taxes, we sometimes skim over details to just get it over with, and Intuit is hoping that when users go to their site this year, that they'll gloss over the fact that you've got to pay to use their services. Intuit and Turbotax are the scum of the Earth and a scourge to American civil life, they're hoping to use this opportunity to get more of your money, but this could be are chance to stick it to these guys.

In other words, its value only increases with time while a material gift's value only decreases with time.


[This](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167811620300045) study found that children up to 12 years old prefer material gifts while children over 12 years old prefer experience-based gifts. Explaining the results: our memory develops and in general, the older we get, the more we value our memories. Material gifts don't tend to create many fun memories compared to experience-based ones.

If someone likes these kinds of studies, [here](https://cognisera.com/what-present-to-buy-for-a-friend/) you can find many more of them summarized. They explore different factors and scenarios.

The conclusion about the main question is the same in almost all of them - most people derive more happiness from experience-based gifts and purchases.

Sure, everyone is different but it's good to have general knowledge, what gifts will more likely make someone happier.Backstory: I reinstalled my Windows, some drivers and for the good part of 6 hours I tried to find out why Device Manager doesnt detect my GPU and also why I can't lock the touchpad or turn on/off the keyboard backlight. It turned out all would be resolved after a 30 minutes full Windows Update. I had the impression I used to update the windows after I installed everything so "knowing that" the frustrations were at an all time hight.

By knowing multiple ways out of a building/restaurant/concert/crowd/etc. it will undoubtedly save your life and your loved ones in an emergency.  The majority of people will all go towards the only way they know out - the same way they walked in…it’s instinctive and when that happens - bottle necks/trampling/death will likely result - and no one escapes.

The first thing I do when I’m out with my spouse/children, and walk into a place, is scan every single way out of that fucking place.  It takes all of 15/20 seconds…but I know exactly where we are all headed in an emergency situation.

Over 100 people died and many of them were found piled on top of each other at the main entrance, inside the club.  They never made it out.  I realize the smoke made things incredibly difficult - but after reading this post - and if you’re ever in a similar situation - the moment you sense danger - you will likely exit out a back/side door unlike 100s of others there with you.

Anyway - this applies to active shooter situations, fires, literally any danger - just know your exits and have a quick plan to get the fuck out.  

Why YSK: This small change in your casual outing habits may save your life/loved ones someday.**Why YSK:*** People almost always blame stomach issues on the last meal they ate before they fell ill but that is rarely the cause. Most foodborne illness takes at least 6 hours to kick in and in most cases it takes a day or more. These same stomach bugs can also be come from sources other than food, such as contaminated water or improper hand washing after bathroom visits. 

Misatributing the source of an illness frequently causes people to disparage restaurants that have done nothing wrong. It also prevents people from discovering the real source of their issues, leading people to continue behavior that puts their health in jeopardy.

From then I realised that one must go for accuracy and not speed, I learned that if you go for speed you will lose the accuracy which consequently won't help in increasing your speed. Go for accuracy while learning a skill, the speed will increase naturally and gradually.

Why YSK: It’s imperative that all of us keep a watchful eye on our pets when they are outside, especially if you live in areas that are shared with or in close proximity to habitats that are home to these types of predators.Why YSK: many companies have a yearly increase for whatever reason they come up with and this price is negotiable. Many of them don’t let you know it’s happened and many of those will lower it in seconds if you call them out on it. 

I just got off the phone with my garbage service and they dropped my bill by $8 within 30 seconds when I got to the billing department. They had it all ready to go and said the reason they don’t give you that price is because “it’s only a call in promotion and not a regular sale”. This was only after I realized my bill was up $5 for the last couple months with no notice to me other than my invoice being higher. 

They know it’s dirty and they don’t care. Just remember that it isn’t the fault of the customer service rep. Just play nice and tell them that you don’t agree with what’s happening, tell them you want your bill lowered or you’ll go somewhere else, and then wish them a good day. They’ve got to deal with a lot of nasty people and they appreciate a decent one as often as they can get itSource -- dishwasher repairman with MANY years of experience: Single greatest cause of dishwasher repairs is using too much soap. The excess soap damages the seals and interior components. Use 1 TBSP powdered soap in the dispenser and liquid rinse aid.
Don't use the pills or the liquid, just powder with separate rinse aid. There will be NO less cleaning, dishes won't be dirtier. I have owned the same dishwasher for 18 years; 2 repairs.

Edit/update: I have begun to pay attention in every store I go to and clearly, powdered dishwasher detergent is harder to come by than it used to be. Likely, this is a combination of supply chain difficulties and manufacturers’ desire to sell the pods, which ensure that you buy and use the amount of chemicals the company wants you to use every time you use the dishwasher.

Why YSK: using 1 TBSP powdered dishwasher soap makes your dishwasher last longer with fewer repairs.Why YSK: alcohol at Costco is often significantly cheaper than at supermarkets, liquor stores, and other alcohol stores like BevMo, but Costco is required by law to allow any one of legal age to purchase alcohol without needing a membership.Why YSK: A friend of mine had left his name and number at a retirement home incase they needed help getting rid of any cars.

Edit: *immaculate* not emasculateWhy YSK: There  are some threads on reddit recently about inkjet printer cartridges and how they are very expensive. The below methods will help save cost of printing and owning an inkjet printer.
  
There are 2 methods I know of, both require buying ink bottles for your respective cartridge model. For HP, You can buy official HP ink (GT52 for colors, GT53XL for b/w) which are quite affordable.

1) The simple method involves using a syringe and injecting the cartridge with ink in the right hole, dabbing out the excess and let it sit for about 10 minutes.

2) The slightly more difficult one is by using something called as Ciss kit. This is like an IV infusion with saline bottle. The kit comes with inktanks with tubes that you need to plug into the cartridge. 

You can google both approaches and there are YouTube videos as well.

You need to know that a standard cartridge will not last for more than ~1000 pages. You cannot indefinitely use a single cartridge, so with either method, you will need to buy new cartridge after a limit.

Some printer models apparently won't allow you to reuse a cartridge if it detects to be empty. So re-fill before it's fully empty.

You may need to buy an additional tool called a cartridge suction tool. It's a small plastic contraption with a a slightly large syringe and is used to remove any air gaps and also helps in unblocking cartridges that were not used in a while.

While laser printers may seem like a nobrainer, they are bit more expensive. A basic hp inkjet printer is quite cheap in comparison and can print in color. With a bit of elbow grease, an inkjet printer can be very affordable.

Hope this helps!This is one of things that you need to do if your phone is stolen. All you have to do is to contact your mobile carrier, explain that your SIM card is stolen, verify that you were the owner and they will lock it. After your SIM card has been locked, no one can use it.

https://m.imgur.com/a/NfDIUIVWhy YSK: Companies will often try to exploit folks who are desperate to get into a field of work. They will offer unpaid internships when they absolutely should be paying you. 

Unpaid internships MUST be for the benefit and education of the intern, not the company to be legal.

1. The intern is aware that they will be uncompensated.
2. Training is comparable to training received at an educational institution.
3. The internship is tied to the intern's current educational program (e.g., with academic credit).
4. The internship accommodates that intern's academic calendar.
5. The internship is limited to the period during which the intern receives beneficial learning.
6. The intern's work complements (not replaces) existing employees' work, while still providing beneficial learning.
7. It is understood that the internship does not provide entitlement to a job at its conclusion.

Non-profit organizations like charities, the government, and schools can offer unpaid internships that do not meet these qualifications.

Many many unscrupulous companies offer illegal unpaid internships when they should be paying you. If you did an unpaid internship that did not meet these criteria (and many dont!), it may be worth talking to a lawyer or reporting the company to the Department of Labor.Why YSK: There are women who were on birth control for many years and stopped taking it only to discover that they aren’t attracted to their husband or boyfriend anymore. It’s a pretty devastating thing to have happen to you and many of them couldn’t salvage the relationship (understandably so). Taking anything that alters your hormones will most likely have an unpredictable impact on your dating and sex life, and while this pales in comparison to some of the negative physical health problems birth control can cause, it’s still a risk you should be informed of.

When someone applies for credit (credit card, mortgage, etc.), the guarantor checks their credit through the 3 major credit bureaus Experian, Transunion, and Equifax. These 3 bureaus allow you to "freeze" your reports, so that nobody can look at them and therefore nobody can take credit out in your name. This process must be done separately for the 3 bureaus and takes about 5 minutes each.Why YSK: Bringing freezing cold electronic devices into your home will cause them to condensate, which also can happen INSIDE the device.

My kids got laptops for Christmas, they are under 8yrs so I wanted to be sure they couldn't access mature content. After installing Norton Family on their computers I tried stress testing Nortons filters and was surprised to find it was not filtering properly through Chromes incognito mode.

After troubleshooting with a Norton tech agent we found that incognito mode was disabling the browsers extensions. So I uninstalled Chrome and blocked google, switched their default browser to Edge as their private browser does not disable the extensions. 

Not sure if this is the case with Safari, but worth testing if you are a Mac user. 

Always stress test your security systems!TurboTax has a charge for processing your fee payment from your taxes. Meaning the $78 they charge for filing Federal/State taxes, they charge an additional $39 fee to pay the fees with your payment.So while it may feel easier to just deduct your fees from the return, IT IS NOT. It's a $40 fee that you can literally get out of paying by paying now instead of with your return. 

&#x200B;

Why YSK: This is useful because you can literally save $39 by just paying now, rather than choosing to not do so. If you have the money, it is literally worth doing.

Don't get swindled by "recommended" button. Don't forget that TurboTax is a for-profit company.

Stop it, you will thank yourself.Why YSK: Liver cirrhosis causes portal hypertension which results in ascites and esophageal varices that can rupture and cause massive bleeding. Also further complications like a bacterial infection in the abdominal cavity may develop. Furthermore alcohol induced liver cirrhosis can lead to Hepatocellular carcinoma. The mortality of liver cirrhosis is high.

Liver cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States, approximately 50% of the cases are related to excessive alcohol intake.

I am writing this post as a response to the post which points out that alcohol is classified as a level 1 carcinogen. Yes the increased chance of developing cancer is worrisome. Liver cirrhosis is even worse.

If you have an alcohol addiction go to a doctor and seek help. Also for those who don’t, try to minimize your alcohol intake as much as possible. (Under 24 g daily for men and 12 g daily for women)

Also promise me to never ever eat moldy peanuts. Aspergillus flavus kills more people than you think.

Before we even get into the what and why, I’m gonna hit you with a little factoid and a follow up question.  

So an adult cat, weighing in between eight and ten pounds, [should be drinking eight ounces of water daily](https://pets.webmd.com/cats/guide/dehydration-cats#2-3). For comparison, an average-sized cat bowl is [about eight ounces](https://www.chewy.com/frisco-cat-face-non-skid-ceramic-cat/dp/282563?utm_source=google-product&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=hg&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=Frisco&amp;amp;amp;utm_term=&amp;amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAoNWOBhCwARIsAAiHnEg86_ZAS9cDMM1nA_BjS1Zzk8ZPgJKIJ6C-aC0qgmzQSq_czHmx6UwaApnkEALw_wcB).  

Now I want you to think to yourself: **when is the last time you saw your cat completely finish its water bowl in one day?**    

“But ANoidEmployed, my cat drinks from its water bowl!”  

Yeah, because your cat isn’t an idiot, and knows if it doesn’t drink *something* it will die. So it drinks the bare amount necessary for survival, but not enough to promote healthy renal functions, for instance.    

Cats drink water from flowing sources, rather than stagnant sources, as an evolutionary tactic [Source](https://www.cats.org.uk/northherts/feature-pages/is-your-cat-drinking-enough-water) [Source](http://www.vetstreet.com/dr-marty-becker/why-does-my-cat-drink-from-weird-places-like-the-faucet-or-the-bathtub) [Source](https://www.cathealth.com/cat-care/nutrition/2376-should-you-get-your-cat-a-water-fountain). Not only is flowing water a sign of a clean water source in the wild, but cats actually can’t even see standing water very well (same sources). What this means is you need to provide a source of flowing water for your cat - a fountain.   

I’m intentionally not linking to any fountains on here because it doesn’t matter what you get. I’m not a salesman, I’m a concerned and responsible (former) pet owner. The one I had cost me $20 and the filters cost about $30 a year, and it took about ten minutes every two weeks to clean it and replace the filter every four weeks. If you can’t spend $30 and four hours per year on your cat’s source of water, frankly, you don’t need to be owning a cat.  

To not provide your cat a fountain is a dereliction of your duty as a pet owner. Harsh words, for a harsh situation I’d guess 90% or more of cat owners are forcing their pets to live through, even if inadvertently so. I’m not stupid or cynical enough to think the average cat owner is intentionally torturing their pet;  you just don’t know what you don’t know. Nobody knows what they don’t know, actually. So now you know, and now you can take the correct action.   

Please, for the love of god, give your cat the water source from which it has evolved to drink.

# Bonus Tip Edit: separate your cat’s food and water.  

In nature, cats don’t eat and drink close to each other because they know that dead animals (what they eat in nature) can contaminate water sources. Even being on opposite sides of the same room will suffice.  

This entire post is about serving your cat’s natural instincts, as we all should be doing.Why YSK:If you type in a Dyson product this website might come up at the top of your search, and I was scammed out of something I purchased. I sent them an email to their customer service address and it bounced back as undeliverable.

Why YSK: this isn't discussed very often, and many are not aware, but it's recommended that both men and women give up drinking at least 3 months before they conceive, as alcohol consumption, particularly in men, can lead to congenital heart defects in babies. According to this article, heart conditions are the leading cause of infant death, too. Pretty scary.Why YSK? If you're in a pinch, and realize you forgot to install adobe reader, you can easily open the file in Microsoft Edge(i know right?)

I had to open a work transfer application and realized I didn't have adobe reader installed but knew Microsoft Edge can do some basic stuff. 15 minutes later and I was surprised at how well it was working with editing the document. For most people, I think Edge is more than enough for viewing and doing some editing.

Also installing adobe reader is pretty annoying when they automatically opt you in for installing McAfee Virus.. I mean McAfee Anti-virus.**Why YSK:** Domain Registrars such as [GoDaddy.com](https://GoDaddy.com) have been known to be shady and purchase websites people search for shortly after they search for them.

To purchase a website bought by a Domain Registrar you will need to go to a bidding war with them. Bidding typically starts at $199 and to submit an offer you typically need to use an agent to do the bidding on your behalf, starting at $19.99 per bid and the agent also requires 20% of the purchase amount as commission.

**Solution**  
Using a neutral domain registration lookup tool like [https://whois.icann.org/en](https://whois.icann.org/en), you can safely verify if the domain exists, who if anyone has purchased it and when. Then if you decide to purchase it, do it in one lookup on the same day.

Issue seems to be with godaddy.com.Why YSK: If you’re not used to traveling, you may not know that the term “free-cancellation” just means you won’t be charged a fee to cancel your booking. It doesn’t mean you’ll be refunded if your paid for your room in advanced. In fact, most hotels have a strict refund policy you should be aware of when booking. Otherwise you may be blindsided by the lack of a refund, and cause an unwanted impact on your budget.

It should also be noted that some hotels will provide a “booking insurance” of sorts. Where, for a small fee, they will guarantee a refund should you not be able to make it. But always read the fine print! Missing a booking can be devastating to your travel budget.Why YSK: The breakers in your house do not "know" what the rating of the extension cord is, or what outlet it is plugged into. They can only protect you and your home from either a dead short, or an overload of your actual home wiring itself. The breakers cannot tell if you've plugged something like a space heater into an extension cord that is too small for such a load.

&#x200B;

The maximum amperage of the cord should be embossed in the rubber, somewhere along the length of it, possibly more than once. That, or the wire gauge should be embossed in the rubber of the cord. If the embossed writing is difficult to read for you or anyone else who might use the cord, you or someone else should make a clearer label for said cord, and attach it to the cord. 

&#x200B;

A 16 Gauge cord can handle 13 Amps if it's less than 50 feet long, and 10 amps if it's longer than that. 

&#x200B;

A 14 Gauge cord less than 50 feet long can handle 15 Amps, the maximum for a normal, single outlet (which the breaker would "enforce" anyway) but a 12 Gauge cord is required for a full 15 Amps, if it's more than 50 feet long. 

&#x200B;

If there's no rating anywhere on the cord that is legible, I recommend throwing it away and buying a brand that does have a visible current rating on it. A 15 amp cord should be safe for almost anything, because most outlets are connected to a 15 amp breaker, so overloading that would blow the breaker in the building anyway. 

&#x200B;

As a side note, although NEC clearly doesn't require extension cords to be protected against overcurrent, I would think that having such a feature might increase the sales of said cord if they boasted/advertised the protection features enough.Why YSK: It's just courtesy. Walking slowly in the middle of an aisle at the grocery store, or stopping right in a doorway, or stopping in the middle of a moving crowd, or accidentally cutting someone off while turning a corner, etc. create bad foot traffic and are generally inconvenient to others.

If you're in a public place, *always* be watching for other people that you might accidentally bump into. If you must stop, make an effort to position yourself out of the way (off to the side, not obstructing shelves, etc) or get out of the way when needed.You’ve all had that experience of phone upgrade promos offering good trade-in credit of phones or tablets on your cellphone provider. You sign the contract, you get your new phone, and set it up. Excitedly you get the return box in the mail and wipe your old phone and disable the find my phone etc. You toss it in the bag and ship it back. 2 weeks later you get a credit on your account for a fraction of what was offered on the contract. WTF!?!?

Why YSK: If you take pictures with your new phone of your old trade-in phone operating in perfect working order and in good condition with no cracked screen or any defects next to your trade in form with account number and imei, your carrier will have no choice but to offer you full trade in credit that was offered per contract. All you need to do is call your carrier and let them know you have these documents/photos and make a note on the account. When you call back the next day they will offer you full value.

Obviously, your phone/device needs to be in excellent condition or you won’t be able to receive full credit. You also need to be in good order with your billing on your account. If you have a bad payment history this won’t happen and or if switching to new carriers they probably won’t help you out.

Best of luck getting full trade-in credit for your devices. CYA!Why YSK: My experiences with post offices are limited to only Royal mail, South Africa Post Office and Indian Post Office. In my experience, if something is sent by post; it either never arrives or even if it does arrive after months, it's usually in a bad condition. If you do wish to send by post office, make sure the items inside are expendable. I have tried to contact post offices for the items that never arrived and I get no response. Packages sent through DHL have all arrived so far. But I have seen recordings of delivery people from DHL, FedEx and Amazon throwing packages, so be wary of that.

On that day I learned that measuring tools should be bought carefully or I should say "...should be bought from well-known and well-respected brands."

Thanks for reading.Why YSK: There are so many people who are still using the internet without any sort of adblocker, even though I personally can't fathom how considering how bad things have become these days online. Not just with ads but also trackers and other annoyances such as sponsored parts of videos or paywalls on news sites.

Seriously, we should all be using uBlock Origin and also uBO instead of Adblock or Adblock Plus as those are sellouts with their "acceptable ads" policies. uBO is also far more efficient at bypassing those anti adblock messages. As a side note, Google Chrome and its derivatives such as Edge will soon be introducing Manifest v3 which will limit the effectiveness of adblockers so it might be wise to switch to Firefox before then. No surprise considering how Google is primarily an advertising company so of course they don't like adblockers. (DuckDuckGo is an excellent alternative btw)

You should also know about Sponsorblock which automatically skips sponsored parts of YouTube videos. Sponsorblock is also integrated in 3rd party YouTube clients such as YouTube Vanced and NewPipe x Sponsorblock from the IzzyOnDroid F-Droid repo. (I personally prefer the latter as it's open source and thus more privacy friendly) Sadly, those apps aren't available on iOS cause guess what, Google/YouTube blackmailed Apple to remove 3rd party YouTube apps from their App Store to sell you YouTube Premium instead and unlike Android you can't side load any of those apps. You can still download Sponsorblock from the App Store and watch YouTube in Safari though. Alternatively you can also use a 3rd party YouTube website called Piped Kavin Rocks which also automatically blocks ads and sponsors.

There's also Bypass Paywalls Clean which can bypass paywalls on news websites. Keep in mind that those paywalled articles are still publicly available for everyone, usually as part of their x amount of free articles per month which this extension can increase to infinite, so there shouldn't be any legal concerns with it. Also use the clean version as the regular version comes with Google Analytics.Why YSK: I got a new number, texted a few people and was wondering why I was being ignored. Then finally I got a call asking about their response. What response?? I tested several people. Why do I get responses from some but not the others? I have service. I chat with IT, they don't have a clue. Then I narrowed down which responses I was getting - Android SMS, or responses from iPhone users if in a group (MMS) or if they designate me an SMS.

Parents may want to restrict image searching to more proven-safe  search engines to avoid "impressionable minds" from being scarred. Realistically, very few of us want to be greeted with random gore when looking for mundane things on the internet.

We should know which tools are best used for finding uncurated results (DuckDuckGo?) and which are better for accuracy and predictable results (Google). I'm just an average user and would welcome suggestions below for alternative Search Engines and what in particular they excel at.

Not only is the first result of that previous search currently extreme IRL x-rated gore, but you get the same exact result simply by opening the start menu and typing it in the windows search. It's just right there. Nothing asking if you want to see web results or images or anything just right there.
I'm not particularly disturbed by gore myself, and I wouldn't make a fuss about this, but people have kids, who search for memes, who use windows. They don't even have to use bing by default now.

I do both techniques just in case.

My nose is hella sensitive to dust and powders so I sneeze quite often and I hate it, so here's some I know that works well for me.

Sneezing is just one of your body’s many natural defense mechanisms. It helps prevent irritants from making their way further into your respiratory system, where they can cause potentially serious problems.

Is it bad to not sneeze? Well healthline says "In general, trying stifle a sneeze likely won’t cause major bodily harm. However, while doing so, your eardrums may pop, or you may have a slight feeling of pressure in your face or forehead" - Stacy R. Sampson, DO

Also, remember to always cover you nose or your mouth when sneezing to prevent the tiny particles from catching everywhere plus it's respectful to do so.

CoinStar either charges a percentage or forces you to get a gift card at the store you’re in.

Edit:
Wow, apparently there are a lot of banks who just don’t do this anymore, or still charge a fee or require you to submit them in rollers. This tells me we as a society have decided change isn’t worth it and should stop wasting money at the mint on anything under a quarter. 
Also, it sounds like CoinStar offers a lot of gift card options like Amazon with no fee. Not bad if you shop there anyway.I have worked in addiction treatment for 20 years, and YSK that in the background of all of these organizations is a quasi-legal economy of patient trafficking. One involes non-profit organizations that ostensibly educate and support the public, then turn around and "sell" referrals to treatment centers for personal profit (sometimes laundered as "you can buy advertising on our website" or "you can sponsor our events financially for a certain number of patients per quarter"). This violates numerous ethical rules and means that some community organizations that claim to be working in the public interest and who benefit from their non-profit tax status also have thriving direct income from selling your loved ones into centers that may not be the right fit for their needs. 

The other more publicized version are the internal and external "treatment loops" maintained between inpatient and outpatient centers. Essentially either one owner holds both centers, and they count on you relapsing in the lower level of care to send you back up to the higher level of care in and endless loop that ends in your death, or the inpatient facility partners with a series of poorly-run outpatient facilities or "recovery homes" that are either negligently or in some cases intentionally inviting relapse, then rushing you back through to the feeder system of inpatient care...is you survive. 

Why YSK: Because this can contribute to the relapse and death of you or a loved one. America has a complicated and complex issue with addiction, but this aspect is a part of the problem, and is not nearly well-known enough and gets ignored when the federal government releases millions of dollars in new grants, that then sadly often go to those exact organizations that continue to prop up more of the same kinds of cyclical addiction factories. 

Please, do your own research and choose the centers that specialize in the kinds of issues you or your loved one suffer from, and don't blindly take the word of community outreach personnel that may or may not have a vested financial interest in treatment failure.

EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you for all of the comments and awards on here. I was really hesitant to post this, because I've gotten into too many upsetting debates online about addiction and drug policies, but I am so grateful for everyone who read this and who wants to help! My only ask is that you advocate and ask for reform in this arena. Let them know you care about addicted people and you're not going to vote for someone who turns a blind eye to this kind of abuse. Thank you!

[Florida Addiction Treatment Scam](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/addiction-treatment-facilities-patient-shuffling-scheme-exposed)Why YSK: I know so many people who always say “triple the recipe recommendation” for garlic. But then I see them just slicing garlic into millimeter slices in their recipe. Right.. found the problem. Most of the time the recipe is fine, you just have to prepare the garlic correctly in order to get the right amount of flavor you want. 

The way you chop and cook garlic affects the strength of the flavor in your dish. If you mince garlic you will release much more flavor compared to slices. A paste will be even stronger (you get a paste by mincing first and then smearing it on the cutting board using a knife repeatedly) 

Also, ~~cooking~~ sautéing/frying garlic less will retain more of its flavor. If your garlic is being sautéed until brown, you won’t taste it as much. If you want a strong flavor make sure you add it late and keep it white. Slow-cooking or roasting whole garlic heads is much different and that method of cooking garlic is not really what I’m talking about here.

Achievable: realistic.    
Relevant: an area in which you truly want to grow.

"Recent research (see "[AKT1 Gene Variations and Psychosis](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/there-link-between-marijuana-use-psychiatric-disorders#akt1)") has found that people who use marijuana and carry a specific variant of the *AKT1* gene, which codes for an enzyme that affects dopamine signaling in the *striatum*, are at increased risk of developing psychosis"

My suggestion is to sing along to a song before you get on your first call, and usually that will warm up your vocal chords enough to get rid of your sleepy creaky voice.

edit: I think a lot of people dislike this post because they’re conflating how things should be with how things are. When you work from home people don’t have all the same data as they do if they can see you, read your body language, and see how hard you’re working. They don’t know what kind of day you’ve had.

For lighter snowfall, you will appreciate having a wider (30" or 36") snow pusher that is lower profile and allows you to easily move light snow and cover more ground quickly.  These shovels are best in 3" or less.

For the end of the driveway after the plow has come through, use a bucket style (or "combination")  shovel to lift heavier and more compact snow that you need to lift & carry to it's spot.  If there is big-time accumulation, you'll be happy to have a scooping shovel (similar to what you may see on a farm) (**edit**: *another user in the comments below pointed out that the term I'm looking for is GRAIN SHOVEL*) that can more easily grab deep snow. 

There are plenty of other designs as well for ergonomics,  bad backs and dual-hand placement and even one I've seen with wheels, so do a little research to find whatever is right for you.  But my message is about owning & having an assortment of 2-3 different shovels for different types of snow accumulation throughout the season.  Shoveling snow is wildly easier for me these days than my first year of homeownership when I just had one basic combination shovel I bought on the cheap.Why YSK: with someone who is controlling your finances leaving may seem impossible- this advice could help you save funds to help with leaving. 

If you need to save cash to get away from an abusive partner who has financial control- use grocery trips to put away money a little at a time. 

If your partner will not see/check the itemized receipt, just get cash back when checking out and save that cash somewhere safe. Bank statements will show the total grocery store bill without showing any cash was withdrawn. 

If your partner does check the itemized receipt, many stores now have free apps to clip digital coupons- my local store (giant) will give cash back for any digital coupons that did not properly come off during check out. Any coupons not “clipped” at least 30 minutes before a check out have to be manually paid out. 

I got $15 cash back from customer service today that will not show up on any receipt or bank statement. Thankfully this is not something I need to worry about , but I thought it may help someone in a difficult situation.

Edit: some comments are stating that cash back transactions show up on their bank statement. This is not the case for any banks I use- but please be aware this may not be the same everywhere. Of course, if you are trying to leave a bad situation please be sure your bank statements do not show cash back transactions.Why YSK: I see a lot of people struggling with their snow blowers constantly switching the chute direction from left to right, when a little bit of planning could make the whole process go a lot smoother.

Basically, the general technique to follow is to start towards the middle of the path and follow an outward spiral until you reach the edge, keeping the chute facing outwards the entire time.

For instance, if you start just to the right of center with the chute facing rightwards, you'll send the snow either off the path or to a spot you haven't cleared yet. When you reach the end of that path, simply turn around and keep hugging the center-right side (what *was* the left side before you turned around). Then just keep doing that as you move outwards until you've cleared the edges of the path.

Same principal goes for sidewalks. Simply start slightly right and send it right and turn around and hug the other side.The idea of huddling around a lovely warm fire with loved ones is so deeply and culturally ingrained that it can be very difficult to accept just how terrible it is for health. But the health risks are clear, and smoke from a wood fire damages your respiratory system and heart in a similar fashion to cigarette smoking. Light fires frequently enough and it can become much worse.

The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#Health_effects) summary perfectly describes how bad it is:

While adverse effects on adults are notable, children appear to be at greatest risk. Many studies that focused specifically on RWC \[Residential Wood Combustion\] have concluded that young children living in homes heated by a wood-burning stove had a greater occurrence of moderate and severe chronic respiratory symptoms than children of the same age and sex who did not live in homes heated with a wood burning stove. Exposure of preschool children living in homes heated with wood burning stoves or in houses with open fireplaces yielded these effects: decreased pulmonary [lung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung) function in young [asthmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthmatics); increased incidence of acute [bronchitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis) and severity/frequency of [wheezing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheezing) and [coughing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coughing); and increased incidence, duration, and possibly severity of acute [respiratory infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_infections). Residential wood combustion [emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_gas) also contain [sulfur oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_sulfur_oxides), [nitrogen oxides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_oxides), [carbon monoxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide) and potentially [carcinogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenic) compounds including [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons), [benzene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene), [formaldehyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde) and [dioxins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioxins_and_dioxin-like_compounds). Some of these pollutants are known to cause cancer but their effects on human health via exposure to wood smoke have not been extensively studied.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#cite_note-9)The Washington State Department of Ecology also published a booklet explaining why wood smoke can be dangerous. It explains that human lung and [respiratory systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system) are unable to filter [particulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates) emitted by wood combustion, which penetrate deeply into the lungs. For months, [carcinogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen) can continue to cause changes and structural damage within the respiratory system. Young children, seniors, pregnant women, smokers and individuals with [respiratory diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease) are most vulnerable. Wood smoke can cause disease and even death in children, because it is associated with [lower respiratory tract infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_respiratory_tract_infection).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#cite_note-Ecology-3) Home fireplaces have caused fatal [carbon monoxide poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning).[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireplace#cite_note-10)

[EPA](https://www.epa.gov/burnwise/wood-smoke-and-your-health)

>The smoke from wood burning is made up of a complex mixture of gases and fine particles (also called particle pollution, particulate matter, or PM). In addition to particle pollution, wood smoke contains several toxic air pollutants including: benzene, formaldehyde, acrolein, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)

[Heart.org](https://heart.org/)

>A [2013 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3685524/) in the journal *Particle and Fibre Toxicology* found exposure to wood smoke causes the arteries to become stiffer, which raises the risk of dangerous cardiac events. For pregnant women, a [2019 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30253313) in *Environmental Research* connected wood smoke exposure to a higher risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, which include preeclampsia and gestational high blood pressure.

Why YSK: I thought that this would be a good YSK since it is the winter holidays, and a wood fire is anchored in our mind as a part of a picture-perfect holiday evening. But the truth is that they are completely awful, and many of us in modern society are still completely naïve to this fact. Just like led-based paint, asbestos, and smoking around children, it needs to be on its way out. Some states are already offering tax incentives to replace old fireplaces. Please just use an alternative method of heating if you have it.Why YSK: This knowledge has very specific and niche application, but it's good to know if you're around anyone who's really into swimming.

Swimmers will learn how to seal off their nasal passage from their throat/lungs by tightening a muscle near the connection point. Doing this stops any water going up the nose from entering the throat when diving, which is obviously very useful for swimming.

But this sealing ability has another use. When the nasal passage is sealed off, you also can't smell anything. At all. This seal is stronger than any other nose plugging method.
Pulling any bad smell-based pranks on a swimmer would be a waste of time because, unlike a typical person, they can just seal their nose as soon as they notice the bad smell. They will also be immune to farts.

TLDR: Do NOT waste your time trying to pull any smell-based pranks on swimmers! They'll most likely be immune to bad smells.Why YSK: other good for yous like mushrooms, onions, carrots, asparagus and even cauliflower taste amazing when pickled.

**Why YSK**: Many people bought Tiles over the years because they wanted a good quality convenient bluetooth tracking device for their keys or valuables. With the introduction of Apple's Airtags and Galaxy SmartTags, Tile has been under a lot of pressure with their extremely limited network. Now that their parent company has switched to one whose philosophy is radically different, those who bought Tiles in the past should reconsider if they want to continue using those products and potentially lose out on a large part of their privacy.

Also something Tile customers may want to know is that Mark Zuckerberg's sister sits on Life360's [board of directors](https://investors.life360.com/investor-relations/?page=board-of-directors).

It is worth noting that when asked about the parent company change, a Tile representative stated, "Tile does not sell/monetize personal data and we have Life360’s full support and commitment to continue that," but that remains to be seen.Why YSK: if someone is annoying you or does something that you disagree with, remember that you can’t see inside their thoughts.   

When you cut someone off in traffic, it’s because you were being absentminded or because you’re late to sing lullabies to your newborn, right? But when someone cuts YOU off, it’s because they’re a jerk. You don’t know their inner thoughts, just the result of their actions in the world.   

So: take it easy on your fellow people this holiday season, and remember the fundamental attribution error. You’ll be less stressed, less annoyed, and maybe even happier! Why YSK: Many people think that Pringles are seasoned on both sides. In fact, only the top side gets a sprinkling of seasoning in the factory. When Pringles are stacked in their can, some of the seasoning rubs off onto the next chip – which is why they've always been a little uneven.

Here’s the step-by-step guide to getting all the Pringles:

1. Fold a sheet of paper in three
2. Insert it all the way inside the container, in between the container and the chips
3. Slide the sheet of paper out for a intact sheet of chips.

Services like this are not rare and growing day by day, however many allow you to sign up through the Google Play/ Apple App Store if you do so via their mobile apps instead of the websites.

If you do this, you can easily cancel these subscriptions on your phone in just a few clicks without having to bother with each service's customer care.Why YSK: Many people have old VHS tapes laying around, not realizing that they will soon be degraded  beyond usefulness.  These could be the only video of loved ones, etc.  If you want to keep these memories, you must convert these to digital ASAP.Why YSK: Recognizing the symptoms could save lives and mitigate/prevent other serious permanent consequences such as brain damage.  You or someone you love could be suffering from CO poisoning right now and not even know it.

My sister and her husband could've died.

I overheard my sister telling our mom that she is still losing hair and can't figure out why - this is red flag #1, but it didn't click in my brain at that point.

Several hours later, my sister was having a discussion with our dad.  For the sake of brevity, here are the important parts:

Dad (joking): "It sounds like your house is haunted!"

Sister: "It literally is haunted.  I see ghosts all the time."

*click*

Me: "Do you have a CO detector in your house?"

Sister: "No.  Why?"

Long story short, her house did indeed have a CO leak.

Other symptoms her and her husband were experiencing:

 - Dull headache
 - Weakness
 - Dizziness
 - Nausea

These symptoms had gone on for so long that they just accepted them as a normal part of life.

Additional symptoms can be found [here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642) and [here](https://whippleplumbing.com/low-exposure-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/)

If you or someone you know are inexplicably experiencing any of these symptoms: get the hell out of the house IMMEDIATELY and pick up a CO detector, then call a plumber/Fire Department/utility company/HVAC professional if it goes off.  You could potentially save lives.

Edit:  Forgot to mention - Symptoms go away after leaving the house for a while, such as visiting family.  My sister and her husband said they feel great when they aren't in the house.  This is another significant indicator of CO poisoning.

It seems to me based on films I have seen, many of them are unknowingly promoting rape culture. In one very popular film I rewatched recently (Superbad), Jonah hill jokes that parties are for getting girls really drunk so they’ll sleep with you.

With recent personal events this shocked me that such a popular film would joke about something like that and normalise it. If you sleep with someone (whether it’s a man/woman) who is blackout drunk and likely would never even consider sleeping with you sober THAT IS RAPE, there was no consent.

If you’re still reading also please read up on symptoms of Rohypnol/ GHB (date rape drugs). Many people think being spiked looks like you’re really drunk, unable to speak or walk but the reality is often VERY different. They can make you euphoric, lose inhibition, increase sense of connection with others, influence decision making and increase libido. If the spiker knows what they’re doing it can be so hard to spot and it’s so important to look out for your friends and ANY indication they may have been spiked GET TESTED ASAP. These drugs only stay in your system for a few hours and we need to start catching these bastards!

Take care, have a good Christmas for those who celebrate it :)

This is not my opinion this is fact. Read through the intoxication section.
"A complainant does not need to be unconscious through drink to lose their capacity to consent. Capacity to consent may evaporate before a complainant becomes unconscious"

My post has actually shocked me seeing this level of hatred in the comments and comments saying “well what about *insert men’s issue*” NOT EVERYTHING IS A MENS VS WOMEN COMPETITION 

This comments section has just proved my point, many people don’t know this and refuse to believe it and it’s kinda scary

I don’t comment on posts about men’s mental health and suicide rates saying “oh yeah well women are more likely to get raped so that’s the real issue”ygm?? They’re BOTH issues, let them both existWhy YSK:


 1. it makes your life better to have them put in the extra effort to be nice to you, so it's nice to make their life better. Usually they don't see a ton of reward.


 2. it costs you nothing to call, and only 5 minutes of time usually. 


 3. It's a powerful statement, because people usually just call to complain. A compliment speaks loudly. 


 4. It's good for the businesses too, to have workers that are pleasant. Everyone benefits from them rewarding solid and friendly employees.

Then they print the check and eventually mail it. It could take 2-3 weeks for it to actually be received by the person/ company you're paying. 

Source: I work for a company that performs Home maintenance services, and it's not uncommon to receive packets of bill payment checks. It appears that when banks have multiple clients sending payments to the same company, they will hold the checks and send them all in the same envelope. I regularly receive packets of bill payment checks, with the checks themselves having dates ranging over a space of two weeks. The number of clients who get angry with me for telling him I haven't received their payment yet, when the bank has given them a date and already withdrawn their funds makes me realize that people don't understand how bill payment seems to work. The funds don't come out of your account when the checks are received, they come out of your account when the checks are printed, which is not necessarily even when they are mailed out.

Note that this may not apply to all bank bill pay systems and you should contact your individual bank for more details.Why YSK: People always comment what they ‘get’ and if you comment on enough of them it’s easy to work out your initials and date of birth as well as various details about you. Combine that with anything you’ve said in your post history and they probably know more than you want them to.https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/ecapWhy YSK:

-depending on your state's public real estate records and laws, predatory companies may be able to see whenever your new deed or mortgage is filed into public record when you purchase a property or refinance a mortgage. They have algorithms set up to comb through newly filed public records and automatically send mailers to every new homeowner or newly refinanced borrower. 

-these predatory companies will spam mail you with offers to send copies of your documents for an exorbitant price which you can otherwise get for free or very inexpensively

-(by the way, other predatory companies will spam mail you with life insurance offers to pay off your new mortgage (even if you refinance) if you die. I just refinanced and got no less than 12 mailers across 2 weeks.) 

-you should never pay any 3rd party company for copies of your deed and mortgage if you buy or refinance a house. Your title company should send copies to you free of charge or for a few dollars. You can also obtain them from the local public record authority for a small charge compared to the insane fees charges by the predatory mail companies. 

This is so insidious because most people don't know how real estate records work. 

There's nothing illegal about what these companies do, but it's very unethical. It costs them 50 cents to mail you a letter, makes you think you need to get the service from them, and if you give them hundreds of dollars for their "service" then they just made 99.9% profit. 

If you need any paperwork after your closing, contact your title company, bank, insurance company, or whatever service provider you've already engaged. Don't fall victim to the public record profiteers.

And if you need life insurance to pay off your mortgage if you die-- don't buy it from them.Why YSK: If you want to gift something like a helicopter ride, call your local airfield. There will likely be a pleasure flight operator there who will charge a fraction of the price of buying a gift voucher from a store. Same goes for spa days etc, just find a spa and book directly. The voucher operators add no value and take a massive cut.Why YSK: The website called "The Aviation Herald" is an absolute must for people interested in commercial aviation incidents and accidents and avgeeks. 

It's ran by a single person who posts only factual and verifiable information about any commercial aviation incident or accident with incredible speed and accuracy.

It's incredibly interesting to scroll through and see what's happening out there.

https://avherald.com/Why YSK: I know it's the season to shit on shitty corporate gifts, and I'm all for it in the event that the money does come out of the corporate budget, but before you light your torches when you get your present, consider that what you received was paid from the pocket of someone not too far removed from you.

25 years ago, when we all got our first 'real jobs' out of college, I remember many of my mates bragging about their company-funded golf games and company-expensed dinners and amazing Christmas bonuses. In retrospect I think most of them were exaggerating/lying, but I always wondered why I never had those perks.

Come Christmas, my immediate manager (we were a team of 12) went around and gave envelopes to everyone. 'Here's the fat Christmas bonus I hear everyone talk about', I thought to myself.

I open the envelope and see a $15 gift certificate to a retail store. 'That's it?' I thought to myself 'I bust my chops all day for $15?' I was livid.

I was livid all the way home. Livid that evening. Livid that weekend. I told my gf how livid I was. I expected her to be livid along with me.

Instead, she said "That was nice of her, spending her own money like that." That's when I realized that this wasn't a cheap gift, but an amazing, thoughtful gift. I was so obsessed with myself, that I didn't realize that we were the only team to get something.

My manager - who wasn't getting paid much more than us, but who had way more financial responsibilities than us - took it upon herself to go out and get each of her team something with her own money - almost $200.

I felt terrible for feeling the way I did, but it taught me a valuable lesson in life.

Happy holidays, everyone!Why YSK: was recently asked this in an interview as one of the final questions and it was super obvious why they were asking me it. As a women in an industry that is made mostly of men, I felt slightly unfairly treated as I'm sure they don't ask men going for the role that question. I've also read that it is illegal to ask that question in some countries. Has anyone else been asked this in interviews? Or is it just me?Why YSK;  I hear a lot of people downplay school and hype up trades. While for some trades may be the best way to a successful future, this does not hold true for everyone. 

I’ve trained dozens of people and watched at least %80 wash out after claiming they could handle it. Why? It’s hard, depressing, you’re going to miss your family get no thanks, and it’s out right demoralizing until you’ve mastered it unless you’re a true die hard country boy or handy man. 

If you or your child considers trade work you have to be In perfect physical condition to even have a shot at the big bucks(some, or most tbh, forego that for hard drugs to cope). There is no I’m tired or hungry when you’re at the mercy of people that have done this for years. 

I will not quit my trade although I am in the process of getting an education. I take pride in building. Aliens didn’t build the pyramids people like you and I  did.

TLDR; do your research before joining trade work. You may be in for a surprise.Why YSK: I figured I'd save someone else the headache I'm currently going though. You should know google password manager is a browser-based manager and linked to your browser's data like history/cookies/cache, so it can be cleared accidentally and easily. A third party app (lastpass, keeper, 1password, etc.) is a true password manager and much better choice. Other things to note if you're new to tech-security and want to be better: Google's auto-generating feature only creates relatively simple passwords and you cannot change the requirements/length. It is **only** available with chrome, while third party managers are separate entities and have apps/extensions. Being linked to google, someone would only need one password on one of your devices to access them *all*.

How did I learn this? Well, I absent-mindedly cleared my history along with all other data in the advanced settings to help try and debug an app. Next thing I know, the entirety of 2+ years of saved passwords, most of which are auto-generated, are gone! Don't be like me. But if you do want to stick with google pw manager, make sure to back them up. There is an option to download a .csv file with all your passwords if you want to move them to another manager. That introduces a whole other layer of risk, so be careful.**Why YSK** lint buildup happens in the exhaust *no matter how religiously you clean it in the dryer* and can create a fire hazard if not cleaned. The excess lint accumulates in the exhaust (the tube in the wall that goes outside) and due to moisture, will build up fairly quickly, so if you clean it once a year, it keeps the buildup to a minimum. 

-Especially if you rent, you never know when the last time was the line was cleaned so it should be one of the first things done before connecting your dryer.-

In states that go below freezing, and in homes where the exhaust line is low, remember to check to ensure the ice buildup is not getting close to the line. The ice accumulates from the ground up, so if it gets too close, knock it over. Most building codes require new construction to be well off the ground but older homes can have lines close enough that ice buildup can accumulate enough that it reaches the line and you can quickly asphyxiate once the dryer is engaged. 

We use the new year as our reminder to change smoke detector batteries, clean furnace and dryer exhausts, etc., and thought it might also help someone else. If you’re uncomfortable performing this task, it is recommended to clean your furnace exhaust bi-yearly and if you ask, an HVAC company will gladly clean your dryer vent, as well.If this happens to you, keep the nozzle in place, shut off the fuel at the pump with the on/off or emergency switch, and tell the attendant who will shut off the main pump and call emergency services.  Why YSK:  I've seen about 69 videos of people who experience this and immediately remove the nozzle and wave the stream of fire around. This will be your first instinct and it is WRONG. To lower the chance this happening, ground yourself when you exit your car by touching the door frame.Why YSK: your data can often still be recovered, and hacked, even after your request that it be deleted was confirmed by a company.

I worked as a data scientist in big tech, and observed that data deletion is tricky business. Data governance laws vary by country and even state, and range quite widely. In some jurisdictions, there are no requirements: a company owns the data generated through your interactions with its services. Other countries/states do have data ownership/privacy requirements, but even the most stringent laws often require that data not be actually deleted.

Many large companies retain data for "compliance" reasons. A request to delete personal data, while often honored for marketing purposes by companies seeking to operate legally (not all do), is often considered legally compliant if a company only locks your data away rather than deletes it. Data access in these cases is usually limited to a handful of people dedicated to the data privacy compliance effort, but the data is often kept for months and even years. This is not a company's fault, but rather is mandated by other laws--ones that help identify corruption, market manipulation, anti-consumer actions, etc.

While retaining data is useful for the above reasons, this legal mess can create confusion for ordinary people. In practice, your data is often accessible even after a company "deletes" it. Given that data breaches in today's world are effectively only a matter of time at any given company, you can pretty much assume that any online interaction you make can one day surface. Companies do have an obligation to try to keep this from happening, but can seldom be counted on as software often relies on hundreds and thousands of other pieces of software as dependencies--consistently updating all of which is incredibly difficult.Why YSK: Deodorant and antiperspirant are two different things. Antiperspirants usually contain aluminum as an ingredient. Deodorants, for the most part, do not. I’m seeing people buy the more expensive brand of deodorant, because the label says it’s aluminum free. Aluminum was never an ingredient in deodorant to begin with, don’t pay extra for “Aluminum free” deodorant. If anything, pay extra for the Aluminum free antiperspirants.

[source2](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-to-know-about-aluminum-in-deodorant)

Edit: Here’s what I’ve learned since posting this….Aluminum free antiperspirant doesn’t exist on the market, because the FDA says you can’t call it an antiperspirant without aluminum(pretty stupid IMO because there are other ways to reduce sweating). So best bet here, is to do research on the product, and see if they have an alternative way to block sweating, but even IF they have an alternative way, they cannot call it an antiperspirant on the market due to the FDA.

Inspiration: https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/rlk9ah/amazon_delivery_driver_helps_save_woman_and_herWhy YSK: The FDA considers antiperspirants as drugs as they prevent perspiration. The only active ingredients approved in the United States in the OTC monograph are all aluminum derived. So in the United States, anything that is “aluminum-free” is a deodorant and will only cover up the scent, but does nothing for sweat prevention, which causes the bad smell in the first place. Any company that tells you their aluminum-free deodorant is an antiperspirant is making either a mislabeled claim, or might be adulterated depending on the situation the FDA deems fit.

[OTC monograph active ingredients](https://ecfr.io/Title-21/Section-350.10)Why YSK: in a traditional PTO package with a set number of days per year, your vacation time is accrued each payroll period essentially creating a bank of days off. Some companies will even let you carry over a certain amount of days into the following year (although that is becoming increasingly rare these days). If you are allowed 3 weeks per year and you are allowed to carry over 1 week per year, over the course of 5 years, you could build up a pretty substantial amount of accrued PTO. If you leave the company, they have to make you whole… in other words, that company is required to pay back all your accrued vacation time at the end of your employment. 

However, with an unlimited vacation policy, no vacation time is accrued at any point throughout the year. So if you had a really stressful year which didn’t allow you to take PTO and the company lays you off in December, you receive nothing. In the 3 week PTO example, the company would have to comp you almost 3 weeks of accrued vacation time.

Also, there is a psychological component in play as well. If employees are given unlimited PTO, most take less time off throughout any given year. If a company says you HAVE to take 3 weeks this year (no carryover), you’re going to plan out that time off. If unlimited, you always think that you’ll get around to planning time off but then that always gets delayed. As one who can speak from experience in my current company, I make sure to assign myself X number of days off per year and track to that. Believe me, it helps.

Just remember, a lot of companies are not “cool” or progressive with these perks that make them seem more attractive, they are usually tactics that somehow benefit their bottom lines in the end.

(Seeing a lot of comments about policies outside of US. Apologies, I should have clarified that all my experience is within US based companies. I am not surprised for a second that other countries take better care of their workforce)Why YSK: You can save money by being more informed about food delivery fees. Those ads you see all the time for “free delivery” really mean “no delivery fee.” There’s also 15-20% service fees, they inflate menu prices, and add surge fees and minimum cart fees. Sales taxes are also calculated differently from app to app! One item that’s $10 on the menu could very well be $17 on a delivery app. I usually avoid these fees by either 1. Picking up the food myself or 2. Using a food delivery aggregator like FoodBoss or MealMe. [Foodboss](https://www.foodboss.net/) has a website, but only operates in a few cities and compares 2 major services. [MealMe](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mealme-doordash-grubhub-etc/id1460140965) works in every city and compares all the apps, but is only on iOS. Whatever you choose, make sure to always tip!Why YSK: Caring for a pet is an enormous amount of work. Animal shelters are often flooded with unwanted animals after the holidays as people figure this out.

Surprising someone with years of responsibility is a horrible idea. An animal should be something the person has planned for, knows how to take care of, and is a good match for them. If you want to give someone a pet, you should discuss it with them far in advance and let them choose. 

If someone wants a pet, give them toys or treats instead. They can pick out an animal on their own. 

Please don't give someone a puppy because it looks like they need one. Animals aren't for everyone. They may not have the time, resources or living situation to support it.

If your child wants a pet, bring them to a shelter to pick one out instead. Also be ready to care for it when your child slacks.Why YSK: Not every place on this planet has the same social or legal norms for quitting your job, buying a car or formating a CV. So make sure to double check with a source in your own language and from your own country. Use common sense, and try to relate what you read in thus sub to expercieas from your life before taking any advice at face value.Our house is 30+ years old and most the sliding closet doors were hard to open and close. I saw a video showing household tips & tricks and they used petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to lubricate the doors and now (2 years later) they still slide along effortlessly.

You have to be tall enough to reach the top of the door. There are usually a two brackets up on top with a small wheel that rides along a rail. If you can't see it you can move your door back & forth slowly and feel around with your finger until you come across a little wheel spinning. Take some petroleum jelly on the end of your finger and touch it to the wheel as you move the door slowly.

The wheel will spread the jelly on the rail and use it up, which is what you want to happen. You should  have to use about 3 dabs to cover the rail & wheel really well. Move the door as far as you can one way then the other. Repeat with the other bracket. Then repeat on the two brackets on the other door.

When you are done with the jelly just use the door handle to move the doors back & forth as far as you can about a dozen times. This makes sure the lubricant is spread the entire length of the rails. You should already notice how easily it is gliding along. If not, then you have other problems.

Why YSK: A sliding door has moving pieces just like hinges move on swinging doors and need lubrication. Most people don't think about lubricating the moving pieces because they are hidden. You won't believe how easily some will open & shut afterwards. This can also help your door from coming off the tracks because so much less force is necessary.

**Edit:**  Thanks for all the helpful comments. When I first did this the wheel felt like some kind of plastic and I was concerned what petroleum jelly would do to it over time. Obviously over enough time there will be deterioration but others have been doing this for decades with little adverse effects. Obviously it all comes down to the materials your wheel / rail are made of. 

 As far as other lubricants, Silicone grease would be the best. ( If you type "silicone vs lithium grease" into google you will find lithium grease is petroleum based like Vaseline). The reason I suggested petroleum jelly is that not everybody has silicone grease laying around, especially those in apartments & condos with limited space. Most people have petroleum jelly. I'm really glad so many people found this useful. Let's keep helping each other out!Why YSK: Speeding is illegal and dangerous. It barely saves you any time while dramatically increasing the risk of accidents, injuries, and legal consequences.  Going with the flow of traffic is the safest and has much lower risk of any trouble. 



[How much time does speeding save?](https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2011/09/30/how-much-time-does-speeding-save/)   Why YSK: it might just be your cat being a loveable jerk.

For the past year and a half, I kept waking up in the middle of the night, wide awake startled. I thought my insomnia had flipped- nope. (I usually have the hard to fall asleep type) Turns out my cat just smacks my face in the middle of the night or bites my nose or toes when he is lonely or cold to wake me up. Caught him a couple of times, and now that I have gotten a bigger blanket that covers my head and feet, it doesn't happen anymore.Why YSK: Friends or family might have had a tough year and might have put a lot of effort/thought into your gift so even though it may not be hundreds of dollars, remember to be kind!Why YSK: the stigma around discussing your wages/salary is unjustified and is driven by employers wanting to take advantage of paying employees different amounts for the same work. You have every right to discuss your wages and may be protected by law depending on what country/ state you are in.Why YSK: Well 2021 taught me that it’s very easy to get brainwashed into a cult. 
Do you know the signs?
1. The leader is the ultimate authority
If you’re not allowed to criticize your leader, even if the criticism is true, you’re probably in a cult.
2. The group suppresses skepticism
If you’re only allowed to study your organization through approved sources, you’re probably in a cult. Cults view critical thinking as an infectious disease and every effort is made to suppress it. Doubting members are encouraged to isolate themselves from outside influences and focus solely on the doctrine of the cult
4. The group is paranoid about the outside world
5. The group relies on shame cycles
6. The leader is above the law 
7. The group uses “thought reform” methods
If your serious questions are answered with cliches, you’re probably in a cult.
8. The group is elitist
If your group is the solution for all the world’s problems, you’re probably in a cult.
Cults see themselves as the enlightened, chosen, and elect organization tasked with radically transforming individual lives and the entire world.
9. Tell you to stay away from friends and family with different views.
10. No financial transparencyWhy YSK: if you're trying to avoid crossing picket lines this should aid you greatly.

[Strike Map](https://aflcio.org/strike-map)Why YSK: I recently left a job because my boss refused to increase my salary even though I had met every target set over two years of performance reviews. He even made me feel guilty for asking for a salary increase saying that I was lucky to have the position and that there were plenty of other people out there that would love the opportunity I had. At the end of the day, if a company is growing and you are contributing to that growth, you should never feel guilty for knowing your worth and asking for a salary increase. If your manager can't see your worth, there will always be another company that will be able to.

Edit: I recently changed jobs and got a 20% payrise - sent my boss an email after I left my previous job saying "thanks for not believing in me and making me realise that others did" lolWhy YSK: If you're like me, yelling was the only form of communication in your household. What many may not realize is the impact of that kind of behavior has long term effects on one's self esteem, view of relationships, mental health (negative core self beliefs, trauma, PTSD/CPTSD, anxiety, depression, etc etc) and needs as a person. Thats why its important to stop the cycle and learn to communicate properly. Healing is definitely possible.

It doesn't matter how well they treat you after or how sincerely they apologize. It doesn't matter if they are your parents or guardians. This is not normal healthy behavior. Healthy relationships involve talking about problems and working things out. There is no hurtful name-calling or blaming things on the other person. If they are willing to call you names to get a rise out of you on purpose, how do you think that will work out with children or years down the line?

Its hard enough to find a relationship, I get it, but yelling and screaming happen when there is not enough healthy communication. 9/10 times situations that involve yelling or screaming could be solved by a calm, emotionally mature, and honest conversation.

If you know you do this, own it. Talk to a therapist about why and work on it. You will be so much happier and healthier when you can communicate your feelings through talking rather than the less effective and more hurtful mode of verbal violenceWhy YSK: It is not funny or endearing, it is demeaning and unacceptable and will make you appear very unprofessional.  Calling someone baby, honey, dear, girl, boy, youngster or the like is disrespectful in a professional setting apparently used to be OK for previous generations but I can tell you that I for one will not work with you if you refuse to use my name and give me a child’s nickname. Sure, you will find people who will work with you but it will not be the A team or anyone with self respect.Why YSK: They're doing you a favour but it doesn't mean other employees will. And if you push too hard, you won't get your deal from those employees anymore, and you could very well be jeopardizing their employment there, so just keep your mouth shut and be happy with what you get.Why YSK: Many people who make <$72,000 use TurboTax to file taxes for free. This year, they will need to find another provider.

Cats are natural predators, and as a result are the largest and most abundant invasive predator of birds in the US. 

Feral cats number over 50M in the US, equating to about **8 billion** small game hunts per year, most of which are small song birds.(2.4 billion) 

Why is this important to me?

**a single mating pair of cats can produce 400,000 offspring in 7 years**

**cats kill about 50% of songbird fledglings (baby birds)** they will never recover at this rate

**a UNebraska study has pinned 33 bird extinction events on cat predation**

**Humans**, almost 8 billion of us and our cars, **are responsible for about 400M deaths of song-birds annually, cats are 2.4 billion** 

This issue is 100% to blame on irresponsible cat owners because they are an invasive species brought here by pet trade.

She got fired last year due to the company having cash flow issues and all of them stopped responding to her messages. She put so much work into trying to make the company successful and sacrificed other parts of her life for them, but they didn't really give a shit about her.

This is exactly the pattern my personal addiction follows, and it adheres perfectly to the typical model researchers have found. Does it sound familiar?

Bonus point for those who made it this far! Advertisements are artificial precontemplation triggers, targeted at ex-addicts.

https://addictionresource.com/treatment/stages/Why YSK: Apparently once you turn 21, many (but not all) hospital systems and medical offices destroy your pediatric medical records. ([Here](https://www.texmed.org/template.aspx?id=1556) are Texas guidelines on this, but these are similar for many states—mine was New York). Be sure to request them beforehand so you can keep them on file and to update your PCP!

I am turning 21 soon and recently requested my medical records from when I was born. My parents forgot a lot of the medical problems I had when I was born, and some of those might be implicated in some of the health problems I’m having now. Plus, it’s good to have the records in order to double-check that you have the right information about your childhood health and that nothing was hidden from you.

Along with a lot of important medical information, I also saw lots of neat things, such as my ink footprints and my Apgar score.why YSK is because i recently just got sexually harassed , and no justice came from it . all because people didn’t seem like it was “ a big deal “
so here’s some if not all the different types , just so nobody has to suffer the same as me . make sure to reach out to someone you love or trust :))

• rape
• attempted rape 
• coming onto a person who is drunk / sleeping / high , that is also rape
• unwanted touching or physical contact 
• unwelcome sexual advances
• unwanted sexual photos , texts , emails , etc . ( not just nudes )
• unwanted flashing 
• making conditions of employment or advancement dependent on sexual favors, either explicitly or implicitly.
• remarks of a sexual nature about a persons clothing , personal behavior , clothes , or body .
• purposely brushing up against a person 
• following or standing too close to a person on purpose .
• cat calling
• coercion 
• spreading sexual rumors 
•  taking photos of a person without their consent , especially private parts ( this is what happened to me , he took a photo of my ass and my teacher’s breasts )

 all types of harassment is important and serious , please never think that it’s not . 
if i missed any on the list please tell me and i’ll add them !Why YSK ; many people get unsolicited calls from telemarketers, cold calls etc. While an occasional call is not bad, there are cases where you are harassed nonstop until you either agree or change number.

All companies within a country that has a Do not call list, are by law required to purchase and keep up with this list. If such a company calls someone that is on the mentioned list, they can risk hefty fines in doing so.

The only thing required for you to do, is find the registry of your own country and provide your phone number to be listed. 

Of course depending on your country, unsolicited calls involving politics and charity may still be accepted. Naturally, calls involving delayed payment and such are not blocked by these registers.Why YSK: because we can’t see you in our mirrors. DRLs don’t count.Why YSK: everyone seems really upset that Elon won the title this year. It just means he was the most influential or impactful, according to Time’s metrics. The publication still deserves respect and support for the work they do, even if you don’t understand their declaration.Why YSK: Many people wash their whites and darks in seperate loads to prevent coloring their whites, using up extra water and time.

**If you use a whitening laundry powder labeled "Safe on colors" AND wash using cold water**, then most whites will stay white even when washing them with dark or colored clothes. I've done this many times using Oxi-clean White Revive and it's always worked. I believe there's other brands with similar products.

Just be careful not to wash clothes with heavy ink (e.g. Tie-dye or sharpie) in the same load as whites.

EDIT: To clarify, the whitening powder isn't strictly necessary unless you want to use a whitener. A lot of people do, but if you don't, then you can skip it.Why YSK: like many mechanical things, zippers have some material on material action as they glide along. Putting some light lube on a zipper track will keep the zipper moving smoothly, and increase its service life.Why YSK: it’s getting colder and colder weather sometimes brings unwelcome guests into warm and safe spots in your car and/or house. They get hungry and will feed on your wires, insulation, and hoses causing expensive damage. Had a 2022 MDX come in saying warning lights were all on her brand new car. After inspecting it. I found the communication wire to be completely torn apart. Luckily I was able to fix it for less than $100, if not, it would have costed about $6K to replace being as that wire was part of the complete dash harness. However you handle rodents is entirely up to you but know that they can cause lots of damage; most of the time insurance companies and warranty companies will never back you up for that.WHY YSK: I see a lot of employers now calling the entry wage offered their "minimum wage". While I suppose they are allowed to use those words, it would be a shame if it caused misunderstanding when they announce they 'raised their minimum wage'. A raise in minimum wage is something currently being urged on government by many as a way to reduce poverty. A wage policy announced by a single employer is not enough.Why YSK: often when Time announces their Person of the Year, it's met with backlash because people think the person they chose is undeserving of praise, and they suggest people they think should have been person of the year instead, providing less influential but morally better options.

Time magazine isn't always praising the person they select. It is who they think "for better **or for worse**... has done the most to influence the events of the year"

Hitler and Stalin have been person of the year. Elon Musk being person of the year doesn't mean that time thinks Elon Musk is the greatest person of the year. They think he was the most influential, whether that be good or bad.

Edit- couple things- I do believe Time was praising Elon this year with the award, however that doesnt change what the award is. If you hate Elon, you shouldn't consider it an insult to the award or to the other people who have won it or anything. And again, when people go around saying that so-and-so deserved it more, they are often misunderstanding the meaning of the award.Why YSK: There has been issues for many years with parents or loved ones who have iOS devices and pass away that their loved ones cannot access their phone data after death due to the security measures on the phone. This has caused many memories to be lost as Apple won’t unlock a phone for anyone but the user. 

You need to update to iOS 15.2, released today. It is on any phone above iOS 6s. When you do, go to Settings, then tap your name at the top, then tap Password and Security, the you will see Legacy Contact.

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212361Why YSK: Those skier and boots are made for a specific way of skiing. It takes a lot of training and outside help to learn the proper technique to take advantage of the things those skis actualy provide.
 The features they provide are great if you know how to take advantage of them but hinder you if you don't. They can hinder your learning and even make you adopt worse techniques as a result of the difficulty. 

An other downside is the cost. Since they are the "best" they are the most expensive.

You can have as much fun if not more with the average consumer ski since they are made for this groupe of people.

Looking at it: the only thing you get from them is the feeling of having pro skiers.Why YSK:

Fully white canes can be used by any visually impaired person. They are often used as a signal to others. My dad is legally blind, but doesn't need the cane to generally walk around. However, he uses it outside to make crossing the street easier. In most places, you are required to stop for people with a white cane (or guide dog).

Also, white canes with a red tip are for people who are deaf blind.

I know this was posted 6 years ago, but I saw some thread of people arguing about if a person with a white cane could see someone in front of them. Sometimes they can !Why YSK: Once upon a time, truffle oil was just oil infused with truffles. [These days, it is oil infused with 2,4-dithiapentane,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truffle_oil ) a hydrocarbon with a flavor that can best be described as a parody of truffle.

I actually kind of liked truffle oil, until I ate the real deal, which is so much more subtle, deep and pleasant in flavor. It’s also far more expensive, sure—Italian white truffles can be over $200 per oz. But cheaper varieties, like Burgundy black truffles, are about a tenth of that: an expense well worth it in my opinion.

What irks me most is that restaurants will have dishes on their menu described as having truffles—truffle risotto, truffle fries, etc, but are really using truffle oil instead of the real thing. Not only do they use this as an excuse to upcharge the dish by ten dollars because of the “luxury” status, they also overwhelm the food with a pungent chemical inferior to the advertised product.

But don’t take my word for it:
"One of the most pungent, ridiculous ingredients ever known to chef," Gordon Ramsay once told a competitor on MasterChef.

Reaching for the oil is "a sure sign of someone who doesn't know what they're doing," Joe Bastianich said in the same episode.

"Fake truffle flavoring is one of those things that's especially upsetting, because not only does it taste like a bad chemical version of the real thing, it's the flavor that almost everyone now associates with truffles," Jonathan Gold says.

So, if you enjoy truffle oil, power to you. But be aware that it is not truffles that you are tasting and paying big money for. And if you ever get a chance, try some real truffles: they rule.

ADDENDUM: As some people have pointed out, truffle oil made with real truffles does still exist. It is hard to find (specialty stores), and priced accordingly (at least $30 for a small bottle). The vast majority of truffle oil you will encounter in stores and restaurants is not this.Why YSK:

Many people vastly underestimate the forces even small bodies of water can impart.

There's a silly little rule of thumb that's actually pretty helpful. If you dropped a flower in the water, would you have time to bend down and pick it up, or is flowing away out of reach by the time you did?

If you can pick it up, you're fine.

If not, basically, if the water goes over your ankles you can be taken off your feet at any moment, mind the rocks, but are okayish.

If it goes over your knees, you're at serious risk of being taken by the stream.

If you're trying to move something with a large surface area, like the wheels of a car, or god help you its deep enough to be pushing on the whole sides of the car, you're fucked.

Moving bodies of water contain incredible energies, water is really, really dense. I mean just think about picking up a big bucket of the stuff.

I see a lot of people drive cars over roads that have flooded and are in motion, and every time I wish I could scream at them before they go in.

Water is so dense, that whole ass car only weighs as much as 1-2 cubic meters of water. Its surface area can have a LOT more than that pushing on it.

Your car absolutely will not win.Why YSK: Opioid overdoses kit [100,000 Americans per year]. If given early enough, Naloxone can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and restore normal breathing. It works by turning off opioid receptors in the brain, meaning it has no effects on someone who isn't being affected by opioids.

In my home state of Minnesota, most pharmacies give it out for free. No special training is required.

Note that it is a controlled substance, so you will need a prescription in some states. More info below. 

>How Does Naloxone Work?

>Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist meaning it binds to opioid receptors and reverses or blocks the effects of other opioids. Giving naloxone rapidly reverses the effects of opioid drugs, restoring normal respiration. It can be administered by injection or through a nasal spray.

>Is Naloxone Safe?

>Yes. There is no evidence of significant adverse reactions to naloxone. Administering naloxone in cases of opioid overdose can cause withdrawal symptoms when the person is dependent on opioids; this is uncomfortable without being life threatening. The risk that someone overdosing on opioids will have a serious adverse reaction to naloxone is far less than their risk of dying from overdose. Naloxone works if a person has opioids in their system and has no harmful effect if opioids are absent. Naloxone should be given to any person who shows signs of an opioid overdose or when an overdose is suspected.

If you work from home and don't drive your car daily, it could be an attractive nest location. 

Last January, my new car that I had only owned for a month, had a squirrel make a nest under the hood. It only took 1 week of not driving for the nest to be made. The squirrel chewed up some wires and did $9k worth of damage.

Sprinkling cayenne powder under your hood will deter rodents from building nests and causing damage to your car.Why YSK: Especially in the holiday season now with retail stores getting extremely busy, retail workers just don’t have the time to spend cleaning up all day. They do in fact have a lot of other tasks to do besides clean up after you, and although they are getting paid to keep the store tidy, their job description doesn’t include being your maid. A little mess is fine, but don’t be that person that all the employees will bitch about when you leave. Making all that mess is unnecessary and you’re making their life much harder when it is __SO__ easy to not.

So if a worker asks if you need help with a size, let them get it. They’ll make no mess while getting it, you get the size you want, and then they have more time for the important tasks because they no longer have to clean up your mess. Everyone wins.

EDIT FOR CONTEXT: Majority of this relates to clothing stores, but works for all goods stores. In general though if you’re making a mess looking for something and an employee comes and asks to help you, don’t say no because you can look for it, say yes because they can look for it without making a mess and it makes their life easier.

EDIT AGAIN: Even if you live somewhere where being approached by staff to help is uncommon (which is crazy weird to me), the point is just don’t make a mess. Regardless of which country you’re in, the workers have better shit to do than clean up after people who somehow don’t know how to look through a neatly stacked pile of clothes without making it look like a bomb went off.

3rd EDIT: Thanks for the Gold, kind stranger!

4th EDIT: This one is for the entitled assholes here. I underestimated how many of you there were but I guess it doesn’t surprise me. I don’t care if you want my help or not. Reject it. Cool. Less work for me. But it’s my job to offer it, and higher ups push it on all the employees to make sure they’re offering it. At the end of the day, you don’t need to rip apart pile after pile like some rabid animal looking for your size. Unfold one or two shirts and then leave them on top of the pile. How entitled do you have to be to think you can just walk into someone’s place of work and create 10 times the mess you should have to? If you don’t want our help, tell us. We won’t bother you again, unless you start tearing away at shit and creating some trash heap of your unwanted garments. Just be a decent human being. God knows that’s asking way too much of half of you though.Why YSK: Cold temperatures condense the air in your tires, so even those perfectly OK looking winter or all weather tires on your car or truck can actually be dangerously low.

This increases wear, affects ride, and changes how the tire contacts slippery surfaces, making it potentially much more dangerous on slippery roads for both you, and the other drivers around you if you lose control.

A tire gauge is a cheap investment, check them at least once a month during the cold months of the year, it'll also give you warning if you develop a slow leak!Why YSK is if you ever deal with an infestation, bay leaves are great at deterring all kinds of pests. All you have to do is put a bay leaf or two in your flour and rice and it will keep them away. You can also scatter the bay leaves around the cupboard to keep them out. This is an old trick my grandma taught me that I have been using since I was a kid.

Edit: bay leaves lose their potency after awhile so you will have to change the leaves out every so often!Why YSK: the holidays are a really tough time for recovering alcoholics or people who quit for different reasons. If someone declines alcohol, don't make a scene or try to convince them to drink anyways.

Have fun, don't kill your family and stay safeWhy YSK: You may say that you just want them to know you care about them.  But the message you’re sending the person is that you don’t care about their feelings, because you’re doing exactly what they asked you not to do.  They will end up resenting you, and hate celebrating it even more**Why YSK:** Depending on how quickly you need something, this could make the difference between getting it by Christmas or not, or having to order on Amazon for a much higher price.

Also, if you're using BangGood and don't want shipping insurance, make sure to uncheck it—it's on by default. The difference in price basically pays for the faster shipping.

**Edit:** since some people wanted more details.

[Here's a couple of screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/k1UiyQj) showing how it works for a random listing on my AliExpress homepage. (Sorry, just on my phone at the moment so it's the mobile site.)

First image shows where to click, on the Shipping section just before finalizing the order. In the second image, you can see there's a shipping option for 91 cents more with an estimated delivery date of 18 days earlier. There's almost always one of those faster options; I do this with pretty much every purchase from those sitesWhy YSK: Someone who works in customer service will almost inevitably have casual conversations with some of the customers, especially if they see the same customers regularly.

When that happens, the worker has almost no way of politely declining the conversation if they don't feel like talking. For one, it could be considered rude, and the worker probably has to take special care to not hurt customers' feelings.

Second, the worker can't just say "Hey, I've got to go" and walk away. They have to stay, sometimes at the exact spot where you're having the conversation.

The only thing that they can really do is maybe say "Hey, I've got a lot of work to do, can we talk later?", but some people wouldn't want to lie if they *don't* actually have work to do, and it can be awkward even if it's true.

I work at a hotel and this happens all the time. It's basically in my job description to be engaged with guests at all times, during conversations both casual and otherwise, which makes them think that I like these talks way more than I actually do.

Even when I try to give hints that I'm not into it by not saying much, shifting my eye contact to my desk, or typing on my computer, they rarely get the hint. It's a terrible feeling to be all but forced to have a conversation when you really would rather not.

Please don't keep people in long conversations unless you're *sure* they're into it, especially if the other party is at their job.Why YSK: On one hand, you don’t know if anyone is in recovery or trying to stay sober. On the other, you don’t know what we like or dislike to drink.

EDIT: Wasn’t expecting this to be so polarizingWhy YSK, this time of year and even more so this year (at least in the United States as far as I know), the mail and package services are completely overwhelmed. This means your mail carrier and package delivery people including companies like Amazon even are working long hours and are on a strict timeline, and may even get extra work thrown on them if they complete their work quick enough and not really be given notice/time to prepare. Plus they can't exactly carry and bunch of food/drinks (especially in cities) to last all day. Doing small things like leaving a bottle of water in the mailbox (marked for them, otherwise they may not take it due to a fear of theft claims) or a cooler even clearly marked "help yourself delivery people" can make a huge difference in their day. 

My mom worked mail delivery for years and she always would point out the houses with glee as we drive through our small town that she remembered would have a bottle of water or snack waiting for her even when she was just a sub, as in didn't even have a set route every workday. When she got a set route some customers would even go as far as leaving her home made cookies and gift cards for coffee or lunch occasionally.

TLDR; Appreciate the people who even though are just doing their job, still keep doing it even when it's not even what they signed up for. You may just be another house if you don't, but you will probably be a highlight of a strangers day if you do and in today's world we need more of that!

Edit; if you are someone delivering please say what country/area of the country/service and what would help you whatever time of the year and any rules you have to follow to accept anything. About to go to sleep, but when I wake up sometime tomorrow I will edit again and add a list as best I can for anyone trying to set up care packages! Obviously water and snacks, but based off a comment I realized I've got a bunch of cheap shake to activate hand warmers that could really be nice for someone out all day.

You are wanted, you belong, and the world is a better place with you in it.

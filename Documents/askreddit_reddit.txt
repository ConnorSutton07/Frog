what about subs that crosspost from other subs to mock them?
The karmaceutical companies would be outraged.
[deleted]
It would be weird to see a post in a smaller subreddit with thousands of points just because it got crossposted somewhere more popular.
[removed]
The thing is that a good post on one sub might be a bad post on another. If something is relevant in one sub but irrelevant in another, the downvotes from the sub where it's not relevant would take upvotes from the post that's highly relevant.
Will totally lead to abuse
Would prevent karma theft
Are imaginary points really that important to you?
Ehh, sometimes you crosspost because OP was a dick, so no
Different subs exist for different content.

should upvotes on /r/watchpeopledie boost a troll post to /r/aww ?
What about downvotes?
Too many ways to abuse that system. You would have people cross-posting their shitposts all over the place.
Karma farmers will just download and reupload the image before posting instead of using the crosspost function.       Regardless, I think it'd be a nice feature.
I dunno OP how would you feel about world peace?
I would rather have development go into a feature where a user doesn't see crossposted content more than one time in their feed.
Does it matter? Karma literally does nothing
No. Just because a post is good/bad on one subreddit doesn't mean it's good/bad on another subreddit.
How would you feel if people didn't use Askreddit for stupid shit like this?
This is not a good idea.  Think about it: someone could game the system and self-cross-post their own work to garner more publicity.  Imagine a musician wants to post their song, after posting a on a major subreddit they could then cross post to all the music subreddits out there that they feel fall within that subreddits guidelines, and even four or five extra upvotes from each subreddits means their post would become extremely popular on the subreddit they originally intended.

Maybe this only would be a good idea if a certain threshold was met.
How about when a *repost* if upvoted the karma goes to the original.
Reddit is entirely comprised of either self posts, or links to other posts on other sites. Another post in another subreddit is no different - just sharing content from elsewhere outside the target sub.

Seems like another easy way to farm karma.
It would ruin subreddits like r/lostredditors

god yall care too much about internet points
On one hand that would be helpful most of the time, and on the other there are many instances where a post is appropriate for the subreddit to which it was crossposted but not the original. For instance, I regularly see crossposts from r/youdontmattergiveup to r/dontdeadopeninside for which I would like to upvote the crosspost but downvote (and report) the original post.

Conversely, there are crossposts that I would like to downvote for being off-topic but I would like to upvote the original.

What I would like to see is upvote and downvote buttons within the crosspost window thing.
How about who gives a fuck about karma.
CAW CAW CAW!
People could potentially game the system to artificially boost posts by crossposting to a ton of subs.
I see this as an absolute win
Why are you asking this like you have the power to do something about it?
[removed]
I just wouldn't care. It's fake internet points that do nothing.
How about Reddit gets rid of this upvote/downvote bullshit all together and just let people discuss. No more karma  crap. Why do people care about karma? Except that it's artificially created drama by the developers and people fall for it.
it's hard to express how much I wouldn't care.
Or just remove karma so people stop whoring for karma.
karma bots would have a fucking field day
Not a fan because a post is as much about the context of the sub as it is about the content.
No. The relevance of subject matter will vary by subreddit. Relevance of a crosspost to r/TotallyNotRobots has no bearing on how appropriate the original post was to r/AliensAmongUs, and visa-versa.
[deleted]
I'd feel indifferent. My penis won't grow bigger from getting a bajillion internet points.
who cares
How about *only* the OP gets the upvotes on their account, but the repost still trends according to current upvotes?
Great
Just because someone posted a submission that is off-topic in a specific  subreddit, that is then crossposted to a more appropriate subreddit and  becomes successful, does not mean that the original poster gets credit  for posting something that doesn’t fit in the original subreddit.
People would cross post their own shit in as many subs as they could find to whore for karma and reddit would get even shittier than it already is.
That would be amazing.
I think if implemented correctly, it really could work. But it needs to be more than just "If repost is upvoted, the original post also gets an upvote", in order to prevent abuse. But it totally could work, and it would also give credit to the original post - especially if it's not the same poster, and the new post has way more upvotes than the original. But it needs to be implemented correctly.
I would also feel pretty good about a feature that upvoted the original post when someone steals karma from  a good one by reposting it as their own.
I think that back when reddit started 12 years ago, most of the audience were IT people sitting in server rooms typing halfway thoughtful comments on keyboards.

Now that it’s just a bunch of 12-year-old dip shit saying whatever comes into their stupid little heads on their cell phones I think the quality has dropped

You can rearrange the deck chairs on this titanic all you want but the fact is they captured lightning in a bottle and then they let it go. Someone else is going to capture that lightning and that’s where I’d like to devote my creative energy.
YESSSSSSSSSS
Sounds fair to me
This would be an EPIC addition to reddit. I have had people cross post things by me and get 3x the amount of upvotes, and have me accused of reposts.

Hi /u/Daler_Mehndi
I’m in love with that idea
I’m surprised it isn’t a thing yet
interesting
I already hate the voting system. Do not support.
Lol. Nearly 180 days since this post has been created. 2 days until this post gets archived.
Upvotes and downvotes are meaningless so why complicate uselessness?
How about a feature where you can cash your karma for real world currency
I see double, triple, n-times voting on the same post.
I like the idea but some posts don't fit particular subs, so a post not appropriate for a sub could get upvoted because it was crossposted into a more fitting sub.
Is Joe Biden plagiarizing again?
sort by top in a lot of small subreddits would be skewed heavily by crossposts to major subreddits
I could see this being abused.
Like it but would depend on the context of the subreddit
Problem is with crossposts that criticize or make fun of the original
It sounds okay, butt I might not wanna upvote the post in the original sub,
Tell me how anyone could EVER successfully implement that, and I'm on board.
Would be better if it upvotes the original and downvoted the copy post
I like this idea, but maybe allow mods to turn it off on their sub.
No because the individual communities should decide what gets up voted in their sub. However links to the same source content reposted within a certain time frame should have this happen, where the original post gets the karma.
Sometimes posts are upvoted because they fit the theme of the subreddit very well. For example, if someone crossposts something from r/funny onto r/breathinginformation then there would be no correlation between the 2 posts getting upvotes. If you upvote the post on r/breathinginformation, you're not saying it's particularly funny, and vice versa. When upvoting, context matters.
LOVE it.
There are some problems, maybe just make the upvote/downvote buttons there for the original and xpost.
Hell no. Original might be a r/lostredditors case, while the second one is posted in the correct subreddit. So. Also, it is good the way it is I don't think there is need for a change.
*casually crossposts to a Q&A subreddit*
No, the original might not be the best place for the post but if it hits r/all then it's the best post of that sub, having even if its not relevant to the original sub. 

If you want to be a karma whore do like every other karma whore.
It makes me realize I prefer my entertainment platforms to be autocracies, not democracies.

I don’t care about points or karma or who made what, or who has seen it before me, or even if I’ve seen it before. Just give me cat pics and little kids falling off bikes.
Only if it's opt-out, on a subreddit by subreddit basis. The subreddit I moderate had a [daily comic post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SchlockMercenary/comments/banhh7/monday_8_april_2019_boink/) do well by our standards - 30 upvotes. One of our subscribers posted [that day's strip](https://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes/comments/basprp/that_last_frame_gets_me/) over to a larger subreddit. It did moderately well by their standards - 2,000 upvotes. 

With the near-automatic crosspost system we have in place today, this linked upvote thing would make a reference/pun dwarf all our posts by a factor of 50. It would've stayed the hottest post in the subreddit for several days, preventing the daily comic discussion posts from showing up in peoples feeds.

I'm all for giving the original poster karma - makes people happy, free internet points, why not - but even when it's relevant to both subreddits involved, upvotes are very different for different communities, and this feature would screw over smaller communities.

 Please. Think of the small subs.
Massive potential for abuse. Just crosspost as much as possible to maximize karma. You'd basically be parallelizing karma farming, which on the one hand appeals to me as someone who like process optimization, but on the other hand would probably lead to an excess of  duplicated posts.
You work for me because someone crossposted my OC and got a platinum and silver while my post got 30k less upvotes and no awards
Wouldn’t matter because karma is fake
I thought that is how it works
I would feel like Reddit is doing something great for the original creators.
Test it, if it helps with rampant reposts: AWESOME. If reposts  become literally every post then burn it with fire
I usually just clicked the original post and upvote that one
we should have a feature where if you reply to a comment, that comment that you reply to is automatically upvoted
it'd be good
You could use that to get double karma
If I like it, I will go to the original post and upvote it there too manually
Woah, or even credit original poster for reposts?
Make it so that it does this unless the crosspost title is marked with /s for sarcasm/satire
I mean...you'd have to have a subreddit that tracked it all to stop the trolling. Otherwise the pedos Et al. are going to have a field day. I love the idea, but just too many sickos out there.
Yes I like it
I dont think this is a good idea. One vote per person is the foundation of democracy. Also it would encourage mass cross posting. I am not in favour of this idea.
Reddit how do you feel about having old people perform a mandatory drivers test every year?
yes please
That's some fuckin' communist shit
This feature would be abused to inflate post Karma across different subs, e.g. post trump negative in r_the Donald then x-post to r_impeach trump... then watch the chaos erupt!
What if the original post doesn't apply to its sub?
I can see this being abused by karma whores.
It will be exploited.
Would prevent karma thieves (which is mostly worthless anyway) but will be sweet candies for karma farm bots. They can crosspost everywhere they please and before you know it, the entire front page is one video from r/funny in 20 different subs.
I feel like this should’ve been a thing since the beginning.

Edit: read other points about abuse, and that in one sub it would be humorous and in another serious etc. and agree maybe it actually isn’t a good idea.
I'd just crosspost my post to infinite subs.
Except sometimes cross posts are done to talk shit about said cross post so there'd have to be the option to prevent that or undo it.
negative. if the original title is shit i don't want it getting my upvote
Well for one original posts are usually stolen content from other sites like Twitter. So they don't necessarily deserve the karma.

Second, content means something different in different subreddits. Votes are partly meant to be an indicator if the content belongs in a particular subreddit.

So no, for those two reasons it is a bad idea.
Subs that crosspost things out of criticism / as a joke would be pretty much destroyed, as crosspost filled subs such as /r/UpvotedBecauseGirl , /r/UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG and /r/whatcouldgowrong would be affected heavily
No.

I don't want my upvote for a post making fun of orginal OP's idiocy to benefit said orginal OP.

It would create a reason to create a shitty posts, repost them to subs about shitty posts and gain karma.
People would start posting screenshots
No.  Crossposts have to stand on their own.   
If you implemented this,  then crossposts become a kind of vote manipulation.   
(2 for one. )  
  
Imagine I post in r/catsbeingassholes and crosspost to r/ginger, r/gonemild, and r/clownporn.   
  
Suddenly my 100 kitten peeing in a shoe upvotes is magically 400 upvotes.
Who cares that much about upvotes? Don't turn Reddit into YouTube, I bet the next stage is profile with 100k+ karma doing adverts....
People actually use those arrows?
I only upvote the original, never the crosspost, but this would save me time.
There should be a special button for crossposts that allows you to do this.
There are some crossposts that are meant to critique or mock. I do love the idea, but because of that, I think having the option to upvote both or just the crosspost would be great!
Are you suggesting a pyramid scheme?
[removed]
That just seems logical in my eyes
I would love this. I’ve reposted stuff before, not for karma, just for interest and it would be awesome if the original poster got credit for it too.
For some reason, reddit cannot be reached when loading the area you were at previously, and thus something went wrong with the scrolling back. Just don't panic!
can i post this question next week? mum said it’s my turn.
Found this after accidentally losing my place and starting at the top. Give me my place back, Reddit!
*Laughs in Apollo*
How would you feel about this question being asked again, just formatted differently?
Why am i seeing this post for at least a third time
'specially when I'm down 500 pages from top of all after about 4 days of grinding it that far only to lose it all from an accidental computer shut down
Why does this get upvoted in r/askReddit? It's something that everyone would either very much like to have, or would not mind having. No point in asking these questions here imo
Is this the Groundhog Day or something?
[wow - op is a massively racist piece of shit](https://i.imgur.com/ZXRl1hm.jpg)

[some more awfulness](https://imgur.com/a/z1Fag8w/)

[also, OPs first comment on their account is on an askreddit post w the same question OP reposted.](https://i.imgur.com/ZwUnARI.jpg)

why are you like this u/Cheap_Double9726
Reddit is Fun has had this feature for a while now. It's quite nice.
How would you feel about this question finally being banned?
How would you feel if these stupid types of questions were banned. You wouldn't be able to farm your sweet karma.
For fucks sake stop asking this damn question. It doesn't even belong in this sub
RIF and Baconreader have this function
I don't ever lose my scrolling place. For me the issue is I see a title I want to click just as I'm navigating away and hitting the back button reloads the listing and it's gone. Then the reddit search obviously can't find the post and it's too early to search for it with google.
How would you feel about a “stop reposting the same fucking questions” button for Reddit
This question again ? Karma farming at its finest
Anyone else get so depressed when the page closes and you know you can never go back?
Sync has this feature
how would u feel if a cure for cancer was found?
This is why I opt out of/avoid the redesign wherever possible. 25 submissions per page, but my screen resolution's thankfully tall enough to fit about 12 at a time.
Same way I felt last time I saw this question.
I didn't realize it but I had already scrolled so far down that I was at the last time this question was posted and had 30k likes. Luckily when I clicked back I got a nice fresh version of this question.
[deleted]
Everyone wants this every time this question is posted. Fuckin do it, damn it.
I would feel better about it if I didn’t read the same fucking askReddit post multiple times a week. Ffs can you just stop repeating this one
I'd feel great because it would mean the end to posting this same question every day.
Why are you spending money on this karma whore?
I prefer reddit as a rogue-like, thanks
[removed]
Good
How do you accidently scroll to the top?? That takes a lot of finger rolling to be an accident.
Ive seen this damn post THREE TIMES ALREADY
I can’t count the amount of times I’m 30 minutes deep into scrolling and accidentally high tail it to the top. That’s my cue to go to sleep 🙃
This needs to be a feature for apps more than reddit. Like placing a marker where you are to automatically return to.
You need to put Reddit down.
Tbh losing my spot is the only thing that makes leave Reddit and put my phone down sometimes.
PLEASE!
Nah. I just have reddit set to hide posts I've voted on. I'm never more than a few pages in before I refresh for new content.
How many times are people going to ask this question on this sub?  I see it at least twice a week.
YES. I'd also be pretty good with a way to refresh my feed and have it actually be refreshed (mobile)
My turn to post this next week.
OP get a life
It be better than the awful preview comments.
This, this, this, please this.
My "end" button does that.
It would be nice. I would just like it if clicking back on chrome didn't give me a refreshed page. Same with YT. I clicked back because I wanted to go back to where I was. Instead I get an entirely new page and can't find the post that caught my eye in the first place.
What a stupid question, who the fuck WOULDN'T want this
No please, accidental top scrolling is the only way I can escape some days and actually do real world shit
It would be a dream come true. And it should work if you close the app on the cellphone too. Like, no refreshes on the page EVER, unless I manually do it.
na, this would ruin the excitment of the experience. on the other hand i dont see, how this can be done. i have learned javascript and i know that reddit works in react and as far as i know, there is no such thing that can easyly set a marker to go back to where you have been. on the other hand, you can change the whole html code with js, so if they let an anchor travel with your scrolling, it might work.
I can't tell you the times I accidentally swiped back from as far down as I was trying show my GF or someone the post.
How many times is this gonna be posted this week?
Accidentally returning to the top is often why I get out of bed in the morning.
As a software developer, I'd feel very impressed that they implemented it.  Seems like it would be quite difficult.
Why specify reddit this should be on every site, I'm tired of that shit.
Why do we even need a scroll to the top button?!

All it ever does is get clicked accidentally. Im willing to bet all my karma, that nobody has ever clicked it intentionally.

If i need to get a fresh page, there is a refresh button built into every browser thats ever existed!
PLEASE
When I accidentally scroll to the top, I close the app. 

It would be in Reddit's interests to add this feature.
Rule 3 you dumb cunt
This has become such an issue in my pathetic life, I’ve started watching where my cursor on screen is and making a mental note. Like okay my cursor is currently directly under my side button. When I lose my spot I can at least be in the ballpark... what am I doing?
Once I was home alone around 17(my age) and always looking for something to eat so I thought I'll deep fry some fries. But a match was going on the TV so I totally forgot I had something cooking and it somehow caught fire and till the time I realised our whole kitchen burned down. I thought I  was grounded for my whole life. When I saw the fire I lost my senses. I had to be rescued from my own home. Fell unconscious just lying down inhaling smoke. By the time I got my senses back I was in a hospital. I heard my mom crying. I thought my parents were gonna kill me after what I had done. The doctor let them come in after half an hour and they just hugged me. Surprisingly I walked away with first-degree burns. Nothing it took longer than a week. Plus top-level hospitality I got.
😇❤
Yes and yes and YES
That'd be useful, but I feel like a "Scroll to my reply" button would be much more useful for me, at least. I always accidentally reload and spend 2 hours looking for my reply-
Yes please. Gimmie gimmie gimmie
I'd like it. Why is this a question? Why would anyone not like this feature?
I wouldn’t care at all. I don’t care about anything.
nobody gives a fuck
What do you mean “How would you feel?” - I know you just ripped the wording from the last person who posted this exact question but this is fucking dumb. Of course it would be convenient, but what is there to even discuss, let alone “feel” about it?
How would you feel if you shut the fuck up instead? I can't believe this ancient repost got more than 100k upvotes.
Would be helpful, but I have noticed reddit will scroll to the top anytime I see a post about what *didn't* happen in Tiananmen Square
I'd never get off if I didn't occasionally lose my place, so I hate this idea
I would feel like I would get lost in a subreddit after hitting it just once accidentally and then messing up trying to get back to where I actually wanted to be initially
Y, es
I would love that
My app would crash
Undo my mistakes
Just make it damn
I don’t mind too much as I usually collapse a thread after reading it. But I wouldn’t mind the button
My number one missing feature
it would be the savior of my soul
just dont accidentally scroll to the top. simple as that
Yes that would be perfect.
Need this. Badly
oh my god please!
Shut up and take my money
Yes, please!
To the top!
Oh dear god yes!!!
This has been asked many, many times... but yeah, it would be nice.
I'd love this, especially the reddit mobile app on my phone loves to take me back to the top after hitting back from being in a post
Yes please!
Not a bad idea
PLEASE. Y E S
Assume that I don't do anything accidentally and stop trying to control me.
I don't have the attention span for that. I just refresh and move on.
Tumblr has this and while it sometimes malfunctions because Tumblr, its definitely a lifesaver and would be much appreciated here.
Meh
Please.
I would have an orgasm EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
I would be all for this!
I'd actually love that
I've done this so many times!!! Take pity, give me the button.
Yes please!
Please!
UHHHHHH YESSSS
I just want a "Stop random comments from inside the thread popping up while scrolling" button
Take my money and run.
I
I would use Reddit more than i do because when that happens I just move on to YouTube lol
I’d be happy if it even took me back to where I was after opening a post.
There is no "back" to go back to, though. It's a constantly changing feed based on upvotes, new posts, viewing settings, etc. etc.  
  
It's not like static pages of a book where you can just flip back to where you left off. Your feed is a timeline-esque section of posts at a point in time (which is constantly changing), so pagination can't really be applied in a traditional sense
Yes please! I think all apps should have this, it would make life so much easier
Glad.
I would feel liberated as fuck.
It was needed about a year ago. I get off reddit when that happens lmao
Yes to this.
Would be one of my most pressed buttons on reddit.
As good as I would feel if this question was never asked again.
The hero we need, not the one we deserve.
Yea please!!!
DO IT. NOW.
I like this
It would definitely be a payed for option
I'd feel good. Finally.
Frankly this is the worst idea ever and shouldn't be implemented to Reddit.
Yea it’s not fun after I’ve scrolled through around 3 days of feed and then suddenly it’s gone
rightclick and open a new tap makes things easier.
Instead, could I have the option to remove the header from half of my screen on mobile when I’m scrolling back up?
I bounce back to the top randomly far too often. So yes please
Every time I hand my phone to my boyfriend to show him a post, he scrolls up to the top before he sees it.
Love
Absolutely not. Losing my place is the only thing that gets me off Reddit late at night.
sometimes when i lose my place i interpret it as a sign that its time for me to stop scrolling and go outside or something. maybe its for the best we dont have that button
Good. But not as good as I would feel about a button to scroll down to the next top level comment (scroll past the 100s of replies if I'm not interested).
Need.
Reddit: "Well, i don't want to be the bad guy anymore."
Awesome
Yes yes yes yes yes YES!
I want this button!
For the love of god please
Say what you want about tumblr but at least it has this
I would've used that right when I posted this comment.
This needs to happen.
Sounds great. Especially when you open reddit for the first time in the day on mobile and you see an interesting post which disappears when the new posts are loaded.
I would feel like this is an overasked question specifically used for karmawhoring.
Yes, please.
Mobile is the worst!! 

Oh wait what was that? Back out....Back out please...back out PLEASE....REDDIT: oh you wanted me to back out and refresh the page? DONE!!!
Probably the same way I felt about it when I saw this question the other seventeen times.
Get me back to where i am
Please make this reddit devs
Please
Lol the reddit is fun app has this and it is fucking amazing.
This question again? Ok, but just tell me... what replies in the everloving world do you expect?
I feel like.....

It’d make too much sense so we’ll never see it
I actually enjoy reading comments (as awful as that sounds), this would be a welcomed feature.
This may be the #1 most posted about thing on this sub and they still haven't given us one 😒
YES PLEASE
Yes 🙏 please
Hell yes.
FYI to those who are reporting this:

> Breaking News, Megathreads, and Mod Posts are exempt from rule 1 and 2 as they serve a separate purpose to the sub compared to regular posts.

[Source.](https://old.reddit.com/r/askreddit/wiki/index#wiki_--breaking_news.2C_megathreads.2C_and_mod_posts--)

Thank you for your civility, and for being kind to the other human beings in this subreddit.

Best wishes.
Not only did this man create an empire that almost everyone loves, but he was a genuine man who just loved to see people smile. 

I had the pleasure of working under him for some pop culture conventions and all he wanted was to see fans smile and enjoy his legacy.  He loved to joke with those around him, and he would tease the ever loving hell out of everyone he could.  

I remember him using his motorised scooter to get around backstage and his poor assistant would speed walk to keep up with him, but he would just keep increasing the speed until she was running beside him. A wicked grin on his face the whole time. 

Or how he would constantly make his staff repeat themselves "what I didn't hear you!" Untill they had repeated themselves four times, witnessing that initially made me sad, thinking his hearing was poor, until he looks at me with that same grin and winks.  

My time with him was short, but I'm so glad I got it, this man changed my life before I even met him, and he made a huge impact when I did as well.   

RIP Stan.  
Was really hoping he'd get to see Avengers 4, but at least he did get to see and interact with his creations on the big screen.

RIP.


His wife passed away not too long ago, too. It must have been lonely to all of a sudden be without his life partner...
A friend and I snuck into a premiere party for a movie. That’s an r/actlikeyoubelong story on its own. But we spotted Stan Lee, surrounded by a posse. A lot of pretty girls and some serious handlers. Here we were, just average idiots in a place we weren’t supposed to be. 

We approached, just wanting to say hello and thank him for his work. The handlers were not having any of it and started to move us along. He stopped the handlers and said hello to us. I got to shake his hand and thank him. He asked if we had cameras. I was kinda dumb-struck by the moment, and forgot cameras existed. He actually wanted to pose for pictures with us.

Still have the photo, and a nice memory of a pretty great guy who was good to his fans. 

Edit: https://i.imgur.com/vFRhI78.jpg

He was the highest grossing actor of all time if you include cameos and supporting actors!
Seriously, there was a thread in here I was reading earlier on today about who you can’t believe is still alive and someone mentioned Stan Lee. 

No frickin way. 
I'm 40+ years of age. When I was growing up, all the Marvel comics I read featured Stan's Soapbox, a short column where he would write about whatever was on his mind. It was like a personal letter every month, and always did such a good job of welcoming all into this little club of misfits and weirdos. 

Stan is different than most of my heroes in that when I think of him, I'm always 13 again.
I guess over the next few years we will see how many future cameos were filmed early. It will be nice to still see him and know that there is more to look forward to

Good bye to a great mind. Between him and Hawking it's been a terrible year. Both changed the world in their own ways.
Since I grew up with superheroes and their ideas of morals, protecting the innocent, ect. I feel like it really shaped me morally, and gave me an interest in criminology and upholding the law. RIP Stan Lee!
This sounds pretty stereotypical, but it means a lot to me...

I grew up in a family with two alcoholic parents and likely abuse-related early onset mental illness. My reality was incredibly bleak from a very young age. One day, I got my hands on an anthology of the original *Amazing Spiderman* comics. Every morning and every night when I got home from school I cracked open that anthology and read each and every comic again and again and again. Stan Lee gave me a healthy escape to a world where all loose ends tied up nicely, where the bad guys always lost, where I knew I was safe.

Rest in peace Mr. Lee. Thank you for everything you've done for me and the likely tens of  thousands like me. 
I'll repeat in what I said in another thread but shortly. He used his platform for selfless purposes and he always stood up for the minority in the face of bigotry. Captain America fought Nazi's, Iron Man was an Alcoholic War vet, the X-Men represented those who had been misunderstood and cast out by society and it's all too alienating standards. Power Man a black man whose skin was his power defended Harlem. REST IN PEACE STAN LEE!!! YOU WERE AWESOME!!!
Damn one last cameo in Endgame made me cry.

RIP to a real one
MODS, CAN WE PLEASE BAN THOSE "WHO IS STILL ALIVE" POSTS? THIS TRAGEDY COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED
I hope the children who fought and bickered over his money don't see a dime.
The year was 2008. I was a high school senior at a college preparation workshop. The instructor presented a quick essay prompt: "Write about who you are." Having been amazed and greatly inspired by the very first MCU movie just recently, I pulled off the top of my head, "I am...Iron Man." This went on to become the basis of my admissions essay, and I owe my choice to pursue a career in engineering to Tony Stark.

Thank you Stan Lee.
I always loved superheroes, and my childhood was filled with Marvel. Spider-Man was always my favorite, because I was a weird kid and found spiders fascinating. I loved him more as I grew up, because there were so many similarities: raised in poor families beset by financial troubles. Quick with jokes to cover insecurities. A deep love of science that shaped everything I did. The implicit knowledge that I may not be the strongest, or the toughest, or the most resilient, but that I always had to stand back up. Intellectually gifted and, with it, a compulsory, driving need to use that to help people. It's why I became a scientist researching psychiatric illnesses, and then later Alzheimer's disease, because I recognized that I had a gift - and so I had a responsibility.

Spider-Man is paper and ink, but he is an ideal I always have, and always will, aspire to. He is my hero. And the man who helped give me that ideal, who shaped so much of my childhood and identity, has died, and the world is a sadder place.

Thank you, Stan Lee. Thank you for your heroes and your dreams. Thank you for helping shape me into the person I am.

*EXCELSIOR!!!*
I know it’s “silly” to mourn public figures who you never personally knew, and obviously my grief pales in comparison to the grief of his loved ones, but this one (and Iwata) really got to me.



I knew Stan Lee before I knew who the hell he was. He was the guy with the cool voice who narrates my spiderman game on N64 when I was a child. It wasn’t until years later that I learned it was his voice, but even before then I learned the name of Stan Lee. He helped create my favorite superhero, Spiderman. He gave my father a line of comics to pass down to me and form a closer connection between the two of us. And he created a character who taught me that I’m not powerless just because I was a kid. 



While it’s easy to write off comic books as a child’s entertainment medium, his work really did have a lasting impact on my life, and that impact has in turn helped me touch the lives of others with his works. I NEVER discuss this outside of my clinical setting, but I use the themes and tropes of Spider-Man in my practice to help clients, many of whom are not particularly intellectual, understand concepts like codependency and hero complexes. Thanks to Stan, I’m able to explain very complex ideas to my clients and help them overcome what I’ve come to call “Peter Parker Syndrome.” So, even beyond his personal impact on my own life, I owe Stan Lee a great debt. 



His is an influence that will be missed. Marvel games, movies, and media at large will simply not be the same without him. Through the act of creating superheroes, Stan Lee himself became a superhero, a household name that influenced generations of people all around the world. May he Rest In Peace, but may his legacy continue to resonate with men and women of all ages for generations to come.

Edit: since people were asking what “Peter Parker Syndrome” is, I’ll copy/paste my response here. It’s an allegory I use to illustrate certain themes:


It’s how I explain codependency and hero complex to clients. 


I started by introducing Spider-Man and his real identity. I outline to my client that, once Peter gets his powers, he goes all in on being spiderman. A running theme in the books is that spiderman is the real identity, and Peter Parker is the “disguise.” 


Anyway, Peter goes all in on being spiderman, and it starts to fuck with his life. He loses his girlfriend, drops out of school/loses his job, and loses touch with family. But he doesn’t care, because he gets to be the hero and that’s what matters most to him.


Time passes, and a villain shows up. Wipes the floor with spiderman. Then he realizes that the one thing he cares about, being the hero, he can’t even do anymore. In some storylines, he gives up and puts away the costume. Slowly but surely, he rebuilds his life. He starts dating again, re enlists in school/gets a new job, starts having hobbies again. And for the first time in a long time, Peter is happy.


Then the villain comes back. In the absence of anyone else who can help, he inevitably puts the mask back on and fights. And he wins. And what he learns (and then unlearns because the universe is reset) is that, in order to be a good spiderman, he has to be a good Peter Parker. And when Peter suffers, so does Spiderman.

I then relate the client’s self care to their “Peter Parker” and their desire to be there and care for others to their “Spiderman,” to illustrate that they cannot engage in the selfless acts they want to if they do not take care of themselves first.


A seemingly simple idea that a lot of my clients struggle to wrap their head around. I then have them keep a running tab of how Peter Parker is doing each day to find gaps in self care.
Stan Lee dying is like David Attenborough or the queen dying, I refuse to believe it's possible until it is
I know I’m late to this post but I met him when I was 17. Shook his hand and asked him some questions and had a muffin with him. He is my hero, I didn’t have the most active male role models in my life and I used comics to fill that void. I learnt more from spider-man about responsibilities then anyone. I learnt all about racism at a young age through x-men and I learnt patriotism and to always fight the good fight through captain America. Of course I learnt weird things like don’t go through space portals or don’t inject yourself with a weird virus as your girlfriend tries to kill you. But most importantly I learnt there is others out there like me who also were alone and needed someone. I grew up when it was still lame to be a nerd and I was bullied for knowing what the circle in iron mans chest was. My first fist fight was over Spider-Man. My first memory of my dad is him reading me west coast avengers. 

To Stan lee, thank you. You helped me grow up and become a much better person then I would of become without you. I owe you so much and it hurts I couldn’t give you more than a smile when we met. But he called me a true believer. So to all the other true believers out there. Keep believing in yourself and others. I love you all! 
I knew it was going to happen eventually, given how he was going on in his 90s. The man has lived a very fulfilling life. He got to see *all* of his creations come to life through Marvel Studios. He got to play minor roles in them as well. Spider-Man, Hulk, X-Men, Daredevil, Captain America, Iron Man, Avengers getting together for the first time ever and many more.

The man has lived a very creative life and breathed super heroes. I'm sad he's gone, but in such a large legacy left behind, all of his creative works will live on.
Marvel Comics were my childhood and even now are a huge part of my adulthood. His amazing stories enthralled me as a kid and continue to inspire me as an adult. Me and my generation will be forever grateful to this man's imagination. through the genre of superheros he spurred our interest in technology and science, opened our eyes to prejudice and bigotry and permeated lessons of morality and basic human decency.

Stan made it a priority that most Marvel Super heroes also show a degree of vulnerability and also in many cases (X-Men, Spider-Man) show them doing the right thing and getting absolutely nothing out of it; Peter Parker would still be broke and mutants would still be persecuted against.

This truly is a sad day, but given all of the allegations of elder abuse I'm glad he's at peace now.

His legend will live on forever. Rest well True believer.
You know it's funny. Stan lee was a person who brought people together. He wasnt just some comic book writer, he was thee comic book writer. Idc if you were a jock,nerd,goth,prep....... everyone single person knew his name and loved him for what he was able to accomplish in his very long very successful life. 95 years old still "acting", still being able to do the things he did with as clear of a mind as his. Today is a day that we lost not only a very loved person but today we lost the greatest comic book hero ever to live.
Late diagnosed dyslexia and attention deficit disorder meant I could't read at the age of 8. That is until my mum bought me a stack of marvel comics. Stan is my hero because if it wasnt for him I would be illiterate. My biggest regret in life is that when I met the man I froze and couldn't tell him this. I now teach English. 
They should make Stan Lee’s birthday a national holiday
God fucking damn it. The queen better stick it out to 2020. His comics were so fucking enjoyable, another great loss :(
I wonder if he already filmed his cameo for avengers 4 and if they will include it still
Mr. Lee, thank you for being my escape from reality. I remember watching X-Men cartoons when I was little and being so fascinated by it, then I started buying the comics, watch the movies, and now it's a big part of who I am. A quote you said about X-Men was, "I wanted them to be different. The whole underlying principle of the X-Men was to try to be an anti-bigotry story to show there's good in every person."  You made me believe that hope. The world won't be the same without your incredible presence. Rest in peace and love.
God dammit its been 5 months and im still not over it once i see a post about him passing away.
The guy created characters that served as father figures for kids who didn't have one in their lives. Provided pillars of morality and courage for many many people.

Can't imagine how many people battled depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts by thinking: "If cap can fight in the name of good and the truth, I can make it one more day".

Thank you Stan Lee. May you RIP.
He has a legendary legacy that will live on forever 
Damn, I really wanted him to make it to 100.
He was born in 1922. 

Ottoman Empire exited until 1922. They also just finished building the Lincoln memorial in 1922. Weimar republic, British Empire, all those were still a thing back in 1922.

Living to the age of 95, having a hugely successful career and all. Sounds like he had a great life.
I was a young Gay kid that was bullied all the time.  The world of comic books were an escape for me.  Many days sitting alone and escaping to the works of Stan Lee.  I remember reading a Hulk comic, where the Hulk didn’t care that a character was HIV positive and saved him when no one else would.  Thanks Stan Lee the characters you created were my friends and heroes when I had none.
Honestly I, a large adult male in his 40s, almost broke when his cameo came up in Spider-verse, especially because of why his character shows up and what he says (heroic sacrifices are a weakness of mine).
Stan Lee's creativity was inspirational to me for as long as I can remember. The characters and stories that he had a part in bringing to life have helped in the creation of some of my favorite memories and relationships. He was able to live a long, prosperous life from what it seemed, and I can only hope that his final moments were painless. If I had to guess, I would think that he is enjoying himself up in the cosmos. Excelsior, and thank you for everything you did Stan.
Years ago, right after Disney bought Marvel, my wife and I were visiting a friend for lunch at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. We were walking around and we saw Stan walking with a bunch of suits. We asked to take a photo and he was so happy to meet us and take a photo with us. He was warm, kind and inviting. He talked to us while the executives stood their looking at their watches. He was genuinely happy to talk with us and spend that little time with us. 

Two years later, we went to SDCC and printed that photo. We knew it was a long shot to run into him at SDCC, but we would be upset if we missed an opportunity. We found a booth that was hosting Stan. They had Spider-Man guitars and if you bought one, Stan would sign them. We get there and there is this huge crowd. Stan comes and starts signing. My wife and I take out the photo in the middle of the crowd and hold it up high. After 10 minutes or so of signing, surrounded by people holding comics up to get him to sign, he spots our photo. He smiles and waves, then leans over to one of the booth employees and says something to him. The guys comes through the crowd and asks my wife to follow him. She walks all the way up to Stan and he talks with her for a minute or two and signs the photo. His mannerisms were so different toward my wife than they were to the people getting the guitars because this was something that was special to us. It has no monetary value.

*EXCELSIOR!*
I remember his wife bursting out during an interview about how he would write poetry to her daily. She expressed how good a husband and friend he was to her and I feel it important to not overlook that.

I'll miss him.

He encouraged creativity in his fans and to my knowledge never judged anyone over a dislike of their creativity.

He was just a darn good dude and I'm happy we had him as long as we did.

Thank you.
Stan, the heros you imagined may have been only that, but you used them to make the world a better place for so many people.

We miss you already. Godspeed, and thank you.
The saddest thing about this is hearing the news of those closest to him trying to extort/coerce money from him. I didnt read too much of it but its always dissapointing to hear regardless.

95 is a grand age but he's also left a lasting impact on comics, TV and film. Couldnt have asked for better really. Thanks Stan!
Every “F” is a Yondu-style Ravager firework in the cosmos for Stan 
One day, when I was a kid, my brother and I walked down the road to the nearest gas station to buy some candy. That’s where I saw Wizard magazine (#34) for the first time, which featured on its cover an illustration of Rogue and Psylocke of the X-Men. I was somewhat familiar with Batman, Spider-Man, and Superman, but I really didn’t know of any female superheroes (aside from Wonder Woman, who frankly seemed pretty lame to me as a kid) at that time. I bought the magazine, and for months, it was an obsession for me. I read it over and over again. I started buying comic books, drawing characters, reading the stories out loud in the voices I imagined each character to have, dreaming up new powers and imagining new worlds. What I loved about the Marvel universe was that there was room for everybody: men, women, people of different races, nationalities, ages, abilities, and backgrounds. It made me feel like comic books were something that everyone could enjoy. I shared my love for comic books with my brother. Although he struggled in school and teachers couldn’t get him to focus, he would pay attention when I read The Uncanny X-Men to him, and when he finally learned to read, it was because of comic books. Thanks to Stan Lee for showing us that anyone can be a hero. RIP. 
Stan Lee was a cool guy. he used to come to my elemenrary school every year during the booknfair and i still have no clue why my midwest school was so special but i know kindergarten til 6th grade he came for 1 day. and i met him every time. 
He taught me through his stories/characters to be me. To not worry what anyone thinks about me. Stan Lee taught me that being yourself is better then being no one, that being yourself is what makes a hero a hero....... I never met him but I lost a father today. 
Stan deserves a Funeral Procession down the entire length of Madison Ave., NY, NY, lying in honor in the back of Thor’s Chariot, escorted by Spider-Man and all of his characters. For his singular impact on global culture, the entire city should shut down. Excelsior.
He made my imagination soar..

I roamed the galaxy with the Silver Surfer, challenged the gods with Thor, explored the seas with Namor and felt the loneliness and isolation of the Hulk....

&#x200B;
My dad, who's past sixty now, grew up reading Stan's comics, and I grew up like many children with a spiderman obsession.

 I remember pretending to be sick so I could stay home and watch my animated spiderman VHS that I got for Christmas. I'd watched it a thousand times but it was still so worth it to put my head against the radiator to simulate a fever just to vicariously experience that feeling of heroism and fantasy. And I'd cough whenever my mum came in to check on me, ha.

It's just incredible the sheer quantity of dreams which passed from this man's imagination into the hearts and lives of children and their parents and their grandparents. In a very cynical age his creations continue to inspire and capture the greatest parts of the imagination. I can't count how many times I have laid in bed at night and pictured myself alongside his characters. What a magnificent legacy.

Excelsior, Stan.
It made me SICK how much karma grinding was going on over the legends dead body. I know I'm late to it but Stan lee will always be in my heart god damn it.
Man this sucks. I grew up on his movies. Reading his comics. I hope he’s having fun up there with his creations. Rest In Piece to a truly great man. 
I’ve always liked Stan Lee’s name. It sounds like Stanley, but isn’t it. It’s cool.


A nice thing I like to think about is if his name is actually Stanley Lee, and he just calls himself Stan for short.


Whether or not his name is actually Stan or Stanley, he will be missed...
if it wasn’t for his comics, I never would ha e picked up a pencil, found art, fallen in love with drawing , gone to art school, which led me to photography which led me to starting my own business. He also introduced hard concepts to my young adult self, taught me the love of reading and imagination. his comics Changed my life. 
You die twice, once when your heart stops and the second when someone says your name for the last time. Stan Lee will never die and will always be a beacon for what it means to be a real life super hero. 

F. 
This is so surreal. Some people you simply can’t imagine dying. 
Rest In Peace. 
I'm by no means a big comicbook fan, but I've always loved the character of Spider-Man, and the shows and movies he's been in. I know that Lee can't read this, but I want him to know that his wonderful writing and beautiful imagination struck a chord with me, and still does. Rest in peace.
I didn't "meet" him personally, but I was front and center at an intimate event in which he and Kevin Smith had a conversation about . . . everything.

Stan Lee had so much charisma it was astounding. Like, presidential level charisma.

We're one day away from Endgame and the last Stan Lee cameo. I will cherish it. Thank you mister Lee for all those superheroes that still and always will have a huge part in our lives.
According to my footlocker full of old Marvel comics that I refuse to throw away (despite my girlfriend's protests), Stan Lee was the fucking man. 

His artistic/business prowess in life ensures he'll continue to touch many young people's lives for years to come. 

Thanks, Stan. 
My first SD ComiCon, I ran into him kinda. He was being escorted outdoors, along the main glass hallway where all the talks were happening. It was so hot, and he was wearing his signature yellow sweater vest and keeping pace with his assistants. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was just hanging outside, and there he was, steady as he goes. I yelled at him the only thing I could, " I LOVE YOU STAN!".

I didn't expect him to hear me since there was a good amount of distance between us and he was hurrying to his panel (The Amazing Stan Lee). But no, with double barrel fingers towards me, not missing a beat, that firm, unmistakable Stan voice we all have grown accustomed to all these years, I hear, "Love you too!".
 
Many years later me and three friends go for a group photo. There was a kid before us, and Stan made sure to take time with the young boy and not let the photographs rush thier moment. 
Once our photo was taken. I noticed how smaller he was now, not weak, but small like my own grandma. Instead of thanking him, I just told him I loved him. He didn't hear me but it didn't matter. 

Out of all the stories and heros and villans he gave us, Stan was the truest hero and champion of our hearts and imaginations. 

Stan was the man. He never let us down, and in his memory I/we should try to be like Stan. Ever moving, bending, steadfast, and fighting for the future for ourselves and others in ways that we can.

Edit: Last thoughts. 
FFS, earlier today I was on that thread of "who are you suprised is still alive?" and numerous people mentioned Stan.
I lived for Saturday morning X-Men in the early 90’s. Thank you Stan for whatever you had to do with that. 
The most heartbreaking part of Avengers 4 will be the part where they show the words "RIP Stan Lee" at the end of the movie. 😢
I am not an expert in any way, shape or form when it comes to comics, etc...my boyfriend told me that Stan Lee makes cameos in the movies and I remember the first time I recognized him! I was so excited. RIP
95 years of good 
I'm sitting here in tears. I wish there was a way I could say thank you to Stan and to Marvel. A few years ago I was going through a breakup from an abusive shitbag. I had completely shut down, was failing out of school, dropped below 100 lbs and a whole lot more as I was coming to terms with everything. I lived next to a boat yard and one day went to jump from the dock. I can't swim. I didn't have the courage to jump. I just sat there crying. I realized I reached rock bottom. That week, my friend persuaded me to go see a movie with her. It was my first introduction to Marvel. I was hooked. 

Thank you Stan. I managed to dig myself out of a dangerous hole because your movies were an outlet. Those movies saved me from myself and the self destructive path I was on. 
Stan Lee and his creations have helped me get through the rough parts of life. I used to joke that I would never kill myself because marvel would keep coming up with movies every couple months, always giving me a reason to live, and that that was “torture”. But truly, I think without those amazing things he brought to life, I would’ve been long dead.
At least he lived to a good age. Most people don’t live past 70
I went to LACC a couple years ago, it was the first year it was rebranded as "Stan Lee's LA Comic Con" as opposed to Comikaze. That's kind of aside the point though. There is no hall H, there is no special panel that you wait days to get into. They were holding a panel on a stage on the show floor and Mr. Lee came up to say a speech and nice things, etc. It was cute and funny. He wound up forgetting to say his signature word which garnered some disappointment until someone said "EXCELSIOR!" And Mr. Lee goes, "Oh!... EXCELSIOR!" Everyone laughed and cheered. It was one of the most strange things in to hear in real life. I regret not taking the few hours to wait and meet him and shake his hand. 

&#x200B;

RIP Stan Lee, I won't forget that memory. It was a good one.
Ultimate Spiderman was the first comic book series I read and the one that made me fall in love with the medium. Even while my fellow classmates were getting into manga I was searching my local library for Ultimate Spiderman TPB volumes. They always seemed to skip volumes and be missing the end of arcs. I remember asking my mom to help me request the missing volumes from other libraries. 

Rest easy Mr. Stan Lee. 
As someone who never got into comics or the culture around them, my interests rarely crossed over with his creations, but I still always got the impression he was a genuinely nice guy who was super into what he did.  The world needs more people with that passion, enthusiasm and positivity.  Sad to hear he's passed, glad to hear that, by all accounts, he absolutely filled his life with what he loved.
I went to DragonCon with a friend in 2010. He had a Spider-Man issue #4 and had me get Stan Lee sign it. I was also dressed up as Princess Peach. I’ll never forget his words to me. “I wouldn’t mind being your grandfather.” 

Oh you amazing human being. We will miss you. 
I hope that in a future MCU movie, there is a scene in with the Watchers where one of them notes that he is no longer on Earth because he was "promoted."

Excelsior.
F
I'm for sure gonna ugly cry when I see his cameo in Avengers 4. Stan Lee forever changed the movie industry and the lives of millions of people. He made it cool to be a comic book nerd. The heroes I've always looked up to are now household names. 

I'll never forget when I saw Iron Man in theaters for the first time. I went with my mom and my younger brother. I was wearing a Stark Industries shirt we bought the day before. When Tony Stark was being tortured my mom made us leave the theater and see a more age appropriate movie, Kung Fu Panda. I said I had to go to the bathroom and snuck back in to watch the rest of Iron Man. My mom was pissed and I got grounded, but I didn't regret it then and I never will.

 Thank you Stan for all the memories, you will be missed.
I literally had no friends growing up, outside of the ones in my comics.  The X-Men were different, so it was ok that I was different.  The hulk was angry and wanted to be alone, so it was ok that I did too.  Spidey always tried to do the right thing, even when it bit him in the ass, so that's what I try to do to.

I'll press it once because I'm supposed to, but only because I dont actually have an appropriate way to tell anyone how important his work actually was to me.


F.
Can we all take a moment to remember and pay respects to the awesome people we lost in 2018?

Rest in Peace. <3
I had a thought today that made me feel better about this.

First of all, he lived a long life. 95 years. And in that time, he not only created many of the characters we know and love today, but he helped turn comics from a niche hobby for "nerds" (at a time when that was a bad thing to be), to arguably the most mainstream media in entertainment today. He got to see his characters truly become household names. He had a lot to be proud of and I think he was proud. 

Pour one out for the cameo master (better than Hitchcock), the story teller, and the world builder. 

RIP Stan. 
It was the characters that he helped create that gave me so much entertainment as a child and even now as an adult. Rest easy. Excelsior! True Believer
Rest In Peace, you wonderful man 
I hope they find a way to work him in some kind of cameo in the future movies. I can't thank Stan enough for giving me such great childhood fantasies. 10/10 would shoot imaginary powers out of my hands again.
Quite sad Stan Lee was not able to watch Avengers: Endgame. I HOPE he was able to see some clips at least.
[deleted]
I’d like to see an end credit sequence in A4 where everyone thanks Stan. Just a simple “Thank you for everything”
Chill he just got transferred to another universe
Very few celebrity deaths make me pause.  Michael Jackson.  David Bowie.  Adam West.  Stan Lee.

&#x200B;

You will be missed.
Man, I always sad that the day Stan Lee died would be a fucking tragedy, but I never imagined it would be so big. I mean, this isn't an actor who played a small part in a single generation's childhood, this man has shaped and led childhoods for *generations* spanning from the 40's to today.

This is an icon, and I look forward to seeing how he will be remembered. I just hope what's left at Marvel doesn't let this man go quietly - Stan Lee should be remembered as colorfully as he lived through his creations.
This really sucks. I've been dreading it for a while, I think we all knew it as going to happen soon, but hoped a little bit longer would be nice.  


I found an old box of marvel cards I started collecting when I was 15 and kinda forgot about it until a few months ago. I've been adding to my collection and it's getting pretty good. Thank you Stan for bringing so much joy in everyone's life. I know a 5 year old girl that's in love with spider-man, it's adorable.   

RIP Stan Lee, you will always be a legend. Thank you for your creation of the heroes we all came to root for and love. Hope your next adventure is as exciting as all the adventures you gave us. 
Today his cameo as one of the Watchers became a reality as he watches us all from above. Rest In Peace Stan Lee.
Excelsior
You inspired me in ways I still have yet to understand. I’m not the biggest comic book fan but I do have superhero’s I adore and the realization you were truly the man behind the masks hasn’t quite sunk in for me. Goodbye you visionary...you legend you. Thank you for helping kids like me cope with life and it’s complexities through your work. Off on your next adventure! Much love Stan.
Favorite cameo by far was his appearance in Guardians Vol. 2, not for what he appeared as but for what he was talking about. I was cracking up as he sort-of broke the 4th wall talking about all of his past cameos in a cameo. Super meta.
I came for questions. Not to get sad.
It would be so charming if all the actors would get together and film like a 10 minute mini movie where all the characters attend his memorial and pay respects 
Stan Lee and those he worked with created the new American mythology that most of us grew up on. We may have known about the Greek and Roman myths, but those weren’t the heroes we identified with, the ones we knew the origin stories to. He created the heroes we indulged ourselves in, imagining ourselves in their roles.

Stan Lee helped many of us see that even a nerdy kid in high school could get bitten by a radioactive spider, not die from radiation poisoning, and take on great responsibility. Or that a group of mutant freaks could walk around in blue & yellow spandex, shoot lasers from behind their ruby glasses, and still be heroes. Or that a pansy weakling could get injected with a super serum and beat the shit out of nazis.

He crafted so many amazing tales and had such a great heart, it’s the saddest I’ve ever felt for somebody that I’ve never met, but who felt like someone that would always be there.
I am so sad to see this today. Mr. Lee gave me the most precious gift. Having grown up a comic-reading tomboy, I have watched every Marvel movie (except Deadpool) with my 12-year-old son, starting when he was probably much too young. But it’s our “thing.” We see them in the theater, just him and me, and then over and over again on dvd.  We talk about who could kick who’s ass and how even heroes are flawed. We debate who our favorite hero is (lately, it’s Cap) and why. We speculate wildly about what’s going to happen next - how are they going to undo the Snap?!? What will the next Stan Lee cameo be?!?

Most moms don’t get that many things that they can truly bond with their boys over. I stink at video games, and he surpassed my soccer skills by age 8! But we have always had Marvel. Thank you, Mr. Lee, for creating a world where my boy and I can lose ourselves and find each other. Thank you for making the world a better - and much more entertaining - place. We never did get to meet him, but if I had, I would have hugged him and thanked him in person. I am so sad I will never get the chance. Unless TAHITI really exists...it is a magical place. ❤️
Stan "The Man" Lee was the Crown Jewel of this Earth if you ask me. So happy, so creative, so outgoing, so accomplished, such a wonderful, influential, inspirational guy, Marvel Comics, and by extension, pop culture, are his baby. I physically can't imagine a world untouched by his artistic hands, nor can I appreciate this one the same way now that he's not in it. Entire generations have come and gone with Marvel, and each and every fanboy and fangirl owes at least something to him. All of his characters, his fictional families, all of his stories will go down as legends, if they already haven't, that is. He's been in just about every summer Blockbuster this last decade worth caring about, and neither comics or cinema will be the same with the reverberating memory of his passing looming over us. I think we all know it was bound to happen at some point, let's not kid around, but nonetheless I wish he'd at least live to see Avengers 4 (or even to see the people's reaction to just the title alone). He deserved more than this world had to offer, and he'll always be remembered as the best of the best. Excelsior!
Don’t really know how to respond to this question 
We'll never forget all the incredible stories you've given us. You've impacted not just a generation, but generations to come. I have no doubt that Stan Lee will be on as many lips as Steve Jobs going down the line. You were a true inspiration, and I hope you've found peace wherever you are now.

Excelsior!
I nearly downvoted this on instinct. Excelsior Mr. Lee.
Stan (directly and indirectly) gave us everything. He gave us f\*\*king megazords, before Power Rangers existed. 

He gave me a little, awkward adopted boy who never questioned who his parents are/were.

Watchers, Beyonder, God, whoever, please bless Stan Lee
I am sure his cameos will keep appearing, but they'll have to be more creative. I would actually be really surprised if the cameos stopped, as they would be a perfect way to pay respects for him and to remember him fondly.
"Ya know, I guess one person can make a difference. 'Nuff said."-Stan Lee, Spider-Man 3 
His death on the news today made me cry, since I was a kid I always wanted to make comics and he was my inspiration, I'd check in at my local comic store every few weeks to pick up an avengers comic and read about Iron man, captain America, Thor etc... Today is a sad day, not just for me, but for the entirety of the marvel community, goodbye Stan Lee, you will live on in the hearts of marvel fans wherever they may be from Australia to alaska. 
From Spiderman blankets, bed sheets, clothes, even underwear, I was raised by Stan Lee's creations. I will never forget you. You'll always live on in my heart, and I will never forget how you taught me even the small guys can stand up for something much bigger than themselves. I hope you rest in nothing but peace and love. Goodnight Stan, many tears will fall in your honor.
F for a man who deserves so many F's but never seemed to be bothered by F's but purely did something he loved
Rest in peace Stan Lee. You will always be remembered.
Excelsior!
Worst. Birthday. Ever.
My mom used to sell art for marvel and I stayed next to his room every time I went to comic con. This is crazy man. He was too nice and genuine. This just got home 
fuck sake, he was just mentioned in a thread yesterday about people who have surprisingly not died yet
Today’s been really rough for me. This doesn’t help. I’m a huge fan of his work, as are we all. I’m even wearing spidey vans right now.

 I just wonder if his last days were comfortable, especially considering the awful news that’s been coming out about his living conditions. 
RIP Stan Lee. I love your comics. You left an amazing legacy.
Marvel movies will never be the same without the cameos of this brilliant hero! 
Seeing his cameos was one of the joys when watching Marvel‘s movies. 
Spiderman is my favorite superhero. I was never able to follow comics since I grew up in Cuba but I was able to get some here and there. 

I love comics and I recognize the reach and the cultural phenomenon that you created, your contributions to the world's culture are inmense and hard to quantify or put into words. You are definitely immortal, that's your super power. 

We, your devoted fans, will remember you forever and keep your work alive. 

Thank you for everything you did, and everything you fought for when everyone else was too afraid or thought comics were silly things for kids.

Excelsior!
Looking back this is still an oof

I got to see Stan at C2E2 a few years ago in Chicago. I thought to myself go see him because who knows how many years he has left. Fortunately, it was a few more.

During the Q&A section of his panel, a young kid came up and said he was doing a presentation about Stan to his class about Stan’s work and life. And he asked for a video intro to the presentation. And Stan could have blown this kid off, but said said sure and the kid had a script and everything. And Stan did the video intro three times for the kid so he would have a good take and a few options.

We all sat in the audience silent as he did it as not to blow the takes too. And I thought, goddamn. Stan really cares about the fans. 

I hope that kid got on A+ on this report. It’s that kindheartedness that makes me so happy for everything that Stan gave to the fans.
Stan has a hand in creating my most beloved and favorite heroes as well as the world they inhabit. I will never forget him for that. The whole world won’t now. 

I was fortunate to meet him at a con 4 years ago when he was 91. 

I wanted to get a photo op with him as opposed to his signature on a comic or something else. I just wanted to meet him and have a pic to remember. 

The moment was fast as they usually are for these sorts of things. 

When it was my turn, he looked over and smiled at me as I thanked him for his work and how I was honored to meet him. He nodded. 

We turned and smiled for the picture. All in all, it was probably a 30 second interaction. After the pic he quipped:

“Well that was quick!”

I laughed and thanked him as I walked out. 

It’s not the most exciting interaction you’ll see posted on here but it’s mine. And I won’t ever forget it. 

Rest In Peace Mr. Lee
Stan Lee's characters have been my biggest source of inspiration since I was a kid and are the thing I am passionate about to this day.

Rest easy. Excelsior.
Wow just logged in and found this. 

Thank you for your work, Stan. Have fun over there. 
I had the pleasure of meeting Stan Lee a few years ago at a VIP party at a local con. He was a fucking cool man.
He’s not dead guys, just frozen. Someday he’s gonna Captain America the shit out of us.
Af all the celebrities that have passed away in that later months and have provoked a big response from their fans, this really hit me and I understand what those fans felt when their beloved personality departed. This guy gave me choices to cope with loneliness, bullying or just slacking off. 
Excelsior!
without the characters he created i wouldn’t be here today. seeing tony stark, a character who made mistakes and grew from them, used snark to hide his problems... but still had people who helped and loved him, who was still a hero despite his flaws, it gave me the courage i needed to reach out and get help. 

the heroes mr lee created or helped create helped me feel strong when i couldn’t feel much at all and i will be forever grateful, because they saved my life

excelsior, mr lee. excelsior. 
He was a guest at my state's comic convention a couple years back. Unfortunately, due to his health, he was unable to attend. However, that didn't stop him from attending his panel. He set up a Skype call to the convention from his hotel room. He was able to answer fans questions and had a smile on his face the whole time. How many celebrities do that? Not many. Stan truly was remarkable.
When I was working at Home Shopping Network back in 2001, we were not allowed to interact with the guests when they came in to sell their products on live TV.  After Stan was finished with his on-air segment selling comics, he walked by my row in the call center and all I, and my coworkers, could do is wave.. low and behold he came our way to meet us and shake our hands.  He was TRULY a down-to-earth, humble guy.  He could have kept walking and ignore us, but he didn't.  Took a quick picture with him!  https://i.imgur.com/dUKv6jN.png

edit:  grammar
When I was very young my grandfather used to baby sit me while my mother would work. My grandfather was a German refugee after world war II and was a young teenager in the 60’s. He faced a lot of racism because a lot of the other kids parents had just come back from fighting the Germans. But in the 60’s when he felt he had no friends he stumbled upon Marvel comics,  They helped make him feel normal, he could identify with Peter Parker being a dorky daggy teenage kid, or the the thing having rocks for skin. He collected and read all of the first issues and series! Now fast forward 40 years when my grandfather would babysit me he’d take me to our local comicbook shop buy me a comic and read it to me when we got home! My grandfather introduced me to a universe that he loved that Stan Lee created. Marvel superheroes have a very special place in my heart from a special place of my childhood! 
this question sucks
My Parents decided to tell me today they’re getting a divorce (I’m 15) and Stan Lee has always inspired me and let me live the lives I wish I could through all of his stories and movies. Now that will mean so much more to me. This is the worst day of my life. Major F
[Edit] Thanks everyone for all the kindness :)
He and his wife both died at 95 years of age. He 35,018 days old. She was 34,850, with Stan only lasting 168 days more
We lost a legend today. RIP Stan Lee. 
Get ready to see hundreds of images of superheroes crying.
I never thought of him as an *old* man, he was eternally young at heart, he was never embittered by his advancing years; he seemed to laugh in the face of Time.
I'm sure he is alive in an alternate universe.
Sad day, man was a legend and a huge shaper of my childhood and imagination. 
I allways was the DC guy more than the Marvel guy but damn will I miss him and am I thankfull for his work 
I thought gods didn't die.
The death of a legend.  But his spirit and awesome stories will live on forever. 
Hope they shot a bunch of green screen footage of him so he can be planted into every future movie as a nod to what he gave us! 
he created the world I love today
Rest In Peace, Stan, and thank you for all the stories that generations of people got raised on
His life will be celebrated. Stan Lee helped so many people and will continue to do so long after his passing. He's more of a hero than anyone he's ever written about. Mankind should be so lucky to have someone like him be with us for so long. Rest easy Stan Lee.
Just imagine, your death being an event that people not only mourn over, but that people dreaded in advance. What a wonderful life this man lead. An inspiration to us all.
Gonna miss this old goofy bastard made my childhood 100% better. Rest easy old friend.
F indeed. Just, hard to get used to.
Stan Lee gave me escape from my shitty childhood.
He gave me friends when i was alone.
He made me smile when I had nothing else to bring me joy. 

Thank you so so much Stan Lee.

Excelcior! 
Ive never met the guy personally, and I cant say what kind of guy he was, but he cared about his work, his fans, and that i can respect.  Godspeed.
I wasn’t a comic book person but I enjoy many of the cartoons and movies based on his work and those of his colleagues. I always loved his cameos on them too he was a brilliant man who brought entertainment to so many and will for the foreseeable future as his work lives on through the ages.

Truly saddened by this. My best to his family and friends during this time of loss. 

RIP good sir!
Today we have lost earth's mightiest hero. RIP Stan Lee, thanks for keeping me entertained for 22+ years of my life. Huge fan of your life's work.
I'm a huge Marvel fan and it warms my heart to see threads about Stan Lee all across reddit. 
Words can't describe how much respect I had for this man. 



F : RIP
Good bye, Stan. The other side needs you more than we do. 

Excelsior!
A sad day for sure, shine on you legend
The thing that fascinates me most is that he could possibly have the biggest celebrity turn out for a funeral ever.  Not even 20 years ago if you said the loss of Stan Lee would affect that many people you would think that was crazy.  But here we are.  
RIP Stan Lee, one of the best writers and entertainers of our time

Everyone: F
The mod who posted this literally did it for karma rofl this is not relevant to this subreddit at all
Man I love Spider-Man because of him. Being 25, I really enjoyed Spider-Man 2 (2004) as that’s one of my all time favorite movies. I loved both Spider-Man games on PS1 along with Spider-Man 2 on PS2. Played those games for hours upon hours growing up! RIP Stan Lee!! 
Isn’t it just tragic that he didn’t just live to see the conclusion of this ten year MCU story? 

Such a nice guy.. 
I, by coincidence, actually saw a video yesterday about every Stan Lee cameo ever in every Marvel/superhero show/film. I never expected him to die the day right after I saw it. I mean, I didn't expect him to live much longer obviously, as he was 95. I even remember seeing a whole bunch of those cameos, even one of them being in the spider-man animated series, where Spider-man goes to an alternate dimension, meets Stan and goes web-slinging with Stan Lee on his back (I saw it as a kid). His movies truly were great (I mean, I personally think that the Doctor Strange final battle was short xD)! Movie after movie, the MCU universe was getting much more interesting. Movies like Black Panther, Thor Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy (volumes 1 & 2) are good examples of great movies. I will miss his originality, movies (I mean, Marvel MUST continue, so I guess there will be more movies) and his cameos. 

&#x200B;

So long Stan Lee, rest in peace.
It's difficult to overstate the impact that Stan Lee has had on my life, not just as a fan but also as an illustrator. He's written some of the best available books on graphic storytelling. I am gutted by his death. 

95 might seem old, but what a lot of younger people don't realize is that while our bodies age as we get older, we are still the same people inside as we've always been. A death at 95 is just as tragic IMHO as it is at any other time of life. 

RIP Stan. You will be sorely missed.
"We wanted to make this thread to honor and remember this wonderful man, so please use it, discuss his life, his work, his cameos, ect and what they meant to you."

The majority of the internet: "F"
This may have already been said but I think someone out there should draw the great character of comics be his pallbearers in a one off print. The casket of Stan Lee being carried by Spawn (image comics), Batman/Superman (DC comics), captain America, Spiderman, iron Man (marvel). Of course that's my six but you can't say that wouldn't be a dope picture. It's the one time everyone in comics could come together to celebrate the life of a great man.
...I don’t feel so good. 

But in all seriousness, he has had a big part in shaping me and so many other people with his work and the whole universe he created.

And what a beautiful and big heart Stan must have had as well, it seems he really knew the meaning of love. He really did create a beautiful life for himself as well together with his wife. They  even lived through losing a child few days after delivery and pushed through it together and her support and love is the reason Stan didn’t quit writing when he was depressed so she is also the reason why we have the characters we love today. A lot of people nowadays give up on loved ones in those situations and don’t value what is really important in life. 

It genuinely looks like they were not only lovers but partners and best friends to each other. It’s heartwarming to know that unconditional true love like this exist. Not many people these days who will one day get at the end of the rope can say that they have been married for 69 years. Truly beautiful love story they had. He must have really missed her in this past year.


What I’m trying to say is that he did not only shape me with the world he created but he also inspires me with his passion, hard work and the way he lived his life. 


He had a long and marvelous life and he will always live on in us and in future generations to come. 

I will truly miss you Stan Lee.
Thank you for your service for improving uncountable children's imaginations and giving them something to rely on, in times of bereavement, estrangement and unspeakable things happened to them in their early lives. These children  looked upon Spiderman and other characters and saw a hero that they could become, how power ensures more responsibility and how to be the better man/woman out of any situation.

Your characters went through the same struggle and hero's journey that reminded those children who are now adults and will forever be grateful and cherish those memories. Hoping one day to become the hero that they wanted to be since the childhood. 

Thank you Stan Lee. May the God of Death embrace you with warm hug.  May the custodians of the path, the two dogs ensure that you have a safe passage. 

So long, old friend, until we meet at the chinvata bridge  😢
A great and influential man that will truly be missed. I met him twice at a convention and he seemed to be incredibly and genuinely interested in his fans. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and close friends in this trying time. 
Creating Spider-Man was one of the most meaningful things he did in many peoples lives. Spider-Man isn't a hero that was destined to be one, he was just a nerdy kid in high school. I believe that he changed many people's lives by saying that anyone could be a hero.
Do you think they'll bring him back for Avengers 4?
He got to see the his work in the grandest cinematic universe ever made and participate in the universe he created all those years ago. I'd say he wasn't too disappointed, it was a good time to go, all the way on top. RIP Stan Lee
To anyone that cares, in a My Hero Academia fanfiction (which is an alternative version of the Chisaki arc) Stan Lee makes a cameo as a retired Pro Hero that gives a rousing speech to Izuku. I read it not long after Stan's death. It hit very hard on the feels. It was awesome.

Stan, thank you for the many smiles and bits of joy that you've given us. You've provided so much entertainment for us all, and left a legacy while doing so. You're truly the superhero that every child should aspire to be. With all love and F's from the reddit community and the many fans around the world, we hope that you rest in peace. We'll miss you dearly.
He had a good run, his legacy will live on, Excelsior! ;_ ;
Rest in peace, Stan. Rest knowing that we will all cherish your legacy and your kind heart.

God speed you brilliant man you changed my life for the better and shall be missed dearly God speed
His contributions to Popular culture can not be understated. The lives he's touched directly and indirectly were forever changed. Now go kick it with the one above all.
Thank you Stan for everything you’ve given us. Your legend will be timeless and unmatched in worth for those who grew up among your works. It quite literally hurts my stomach to say, Rest In Peace Stan, you will be loved and missed unconditionally.
Anyone watch that show where he goes around finding people with  extraordinary abilities and talents irl? I loved that show.
This is such sad news. After his wife died, I had a feeling he was soon to follow, just hoped it'd be a bit later. 
R.I.P. Mr Stan Lee.
I'm gonna miss his cameos. I know they filmed a few in advance, an who knows, maybe they 3D scanned him to make some convincing CGI later, but finding his cameos always made me laugh.

Best one is from Deadpool 1, nobody expects a 90 yo as a strip club bouncer. 
Thanks for the many hours of laughter and tears Stan. The fictional universe you created had so much depth that I could have sworn it was real.

F.
RIP, Godspeed, & Thank you very, very much for everything Stan.
F to the great bringer of joy, been a fan since I was a child grew up on spiderman like any others! Respect to the man that joined the one above all!
Looking forward to the cameo in heaven. Rest in peace you magnificent bastard.
I'll be honest, I was never really into Marvel superheroes or any superhero franchise, but he really truly was a legendary man. He was a hero for many of my friends, and his legacy will live on in our childhoods and in those of the future generations. Rest in peace, long live in memory Stan Lee. 
Man, just a little while ago I was reading a post talking about him and I absolutely teared up just from that, this man is by far the only celebrity that I cared about purely because he was such a wholesome and wonderful person his entire life, who created so much joy for millions of people and I hope to send support and good vibes to everyone that had the pleasure to be in his life.
I met him once at a comic book convention in maybe 1989-1990. I thought it was really neat. Today I know that it was a blessing.

He was a badass yesterday, imagine him almost three decades ago. 
The first time I have ever felt true sadness from the death of a celebrity. Stan Lee plays a huge part in developing my love for pop culture. Thank You.
Can't wait for the CGI Stan Lee cameos 
This morning I woke up and heard the terrible news.

I don’t think i’ve ever been this upset about a celebrity death. As a kid I grew up watching the Spider-Man and X-Men cartoons as well as reading any Marvel comics I could, plus play the video games.

Getting older i’ve been able to go back and read the stories that he himself wrote and they are brilliant. It’s really a universe coming to life.

I never got to meet him, but the characters he created left a lasting impression on this nerdy 30 year old.

Rest In Peace Stan.

You know, I'm not that sad. He did such a massive amount of work, and his legacy will live on for decades, maybe centuries. In fact, once we leave this planet through extinction or intergalactic travel, I'd bet on aliens coming here and finding relics of the heroes he created. Maybe they'll believe they're true, if only briefly.

And now, after nearly a century of work, he can lay to rest, remembered for the legends he created, and the legend he was.
This man created a modern day mythology. What an absolute unit.
Thank you, Stan Lee - For everything. Also, you were kind of my wingman. 

 I scored a date with my current girlfriend by inviting her to see Spider Man. When we left the theater, we pretended to shoot web & soar between buildings in the city of Los Angeles. We named a duck couple  in my neighborhood, Petey & Gwendy. They even had baby ducklings. She introduced me to Spider Man Blue & I fell in love with her & with the story about about Peter Parkers first true love.  
"We wanted to make this thread to honor and remember this wonderful man, so please use it discuss his life, his work, his cameos, etc and what they meant to you."

98% of people in this thread: "F". 
I really hope they don't make a CGI Stan Lee to cameo in the Marvel films from now on, it just won't be the same as having him there and distasteful to his memory.
I think it so strange that there was an askreddit thread *THE OTHER DAY* about who people think is crazy that they're still alive.  Stan Lee was one of them.

RIP.
1,000 years from now  this man’s universe will still be known and told.. legendary Human being. I raise my glass to you Stan for living one hell of an amazing life
Met him at fan expo years ago. Got his autograph on issue 50 of What if the Hulk killed the Wolverine. The man smiled. I will and many across the universe & all the other universes will miss him.

This man is behind many of my childhood hero's and villians. Especially the villians.

My kids as well

He will be missed.

RIP. EXCLESIOR!!!
Back in 2014 my wife and I attended PAC-CON in Spokane for our anniversary. It was hosted by Stan Lee and William Shatner. While we were waking around and enjoying the booths and sights of celebrity voice actors and the such, we walked passed a photo booth blocked off by black plastic wrap. I looked at my wife and said "I bet that's where Stan and bill are doing there photos with people."  A few moments later Stan walked out of the side of the booth area, greeted us and shook our hands. It was only a few seconds of interaction, but it was well worth the ticket price just to meet him and say hello. Later my wife damn near hyperventilated when she saw William Shatner. Times that I will never forget. 
Stan has impacted so many lives in so many ways, and I’m no exception. I’ve always loved Marvel, especially Spider-Man, and long after Stan the Man steps down from the position of King of Cameos, his work will continue to inspire me, as I hope it will with all of you. I’ll never forget the impact he’s had on my life, from one of my first video games (Spider-Man: Web of Shadows for the PS2 at like age 6 I think) to my newest one (Spider-Man PS4 in about 2 weeks), from my first comic to my last, I’ll never forget my generalissimo. Because although he’s gone from the world, he’s still within all of us. It sounds cheesy I know, but it’s true. He’s the gamma radiation, the super soldier serum, the shrapnel in our hearts. He’s the pym particles we breathe. He’s the spider DNA in our blood. He’s the Uncle Ben in our dreams. Stay strong, True Believers. He’d want it that way.

Excelsior.
My dad, brother, and I would often find a bond in watching MCU movies, or superhero and action films in general. One of the highlights of the MCU movies is Sir Stan Lee's cameos. All three of us would eagerly wait for his cameos, sometimes even re-watching a whole movie just because we forgot which scene he appeared in. We are very fond of him.

There are just no words to express how much I respect this man.
RIP Stan Lee. May he always be remembered for his great deeds and marvellous achievements over his long and fulfilling life. I hope that if there is truely a afterlife  that he has been able to peacefully reunite with all the loved ones who had passed before him.


May be Rest In Peace.

Today a true legend falls. Rip Stan Lee. The world will never be the same without. 
I aspire to have a legacy like him. May his legend live on forever.
At least he managed to feature in the super hero movie of the century before he passed.

Teen titans go to the movies.
Stan Lee's work has always been a lighthouse that would help me find the way through the darkest times. What has done in life truly will echo through eternity thanks to the many inspired by him.  You will be miss, and always loved, Stan.

Excelsior!
His stories and characters taught me that people aren't good or bad, that we need to fight for what or who we believe in, and that anyone can become a hero. 
Marvel has become an important part of who I am, and it has touched many others in the same way.
Rest in peace, Stan. You're a legend.
Pains to read the first sentence of his Wikipedia page. "Was" is a sad word in these kind of situations. Big respect for the hero who created heroes. Rest in peace, Stanley.

Gone but never forgotten. We'll miss him.
For all the drama and fighting going on in comic books today, it's sad that we lost someone who was so loved and so unifying as Stan Lee. 
F for an absolute legend. He will forever be known as one of the most culturally influential people in all of human history. 
Rest in peace. Truly a legend, we'll miss him. I hope they do some sort of "In memory of Stan Lee" in the next Avenger's movie. 
Thank you Stan Lee for creating some of my favorite characters and worlds.  I had a shitty childhood and the amazing art and storytelling of comics helped me escape and invited  me  to dream of a world where I could make a difference. I'm super sad but I'm glad he gave us so much.
Thank you for giving us some of the best characters in literature history. F.

Thank you Stan Lee, your stories, characters and ideas were a huge part of my childhood and you will always be a true hero to me.
His death actually gave me the same feeling I had when my grandfather died. He was a real hero with such a kind work. Rest in peace and I dearly believe he's in a far greater place than here.
Rip Stan, you made comics and characters that have impacted the world! Gone but not forgotten, remembered forever. Thanks for all you’ve done. 🤟
R.I.P. Stan, you created great things while on this earth and it will be remembered for lifetimes to come. Sleep well, you deserve it. 
Tony Stark's real father just passed away.

Stan, thank you for being my hero. Even with all the heroes you’ve created, you’ve always been the one I admire the most.
I guess one man can make a difference. Rip Stan the Man. Was doing a binge reading of all the Spiderman series.

Excelsior!
Rest in peace
I was going into a movie theater to watch the new grinch movie when my sister told me about him, R.I.P Stan "the man" Lee I always wanted to meet you, what a shame I never could, but i was prepared considering his age and health issues.
It made me SICK how much karma grinding was going on over the legends dead body. I know I'm late to it but Stan lee will always be in my heart god damn it.
I still haven’t come to terms with the fact that Endgame is going to be his last cameo
I’m usually not moved by celebrity deaths even if they made an impact on the world.  As death is a part of life but this one really hits me because Stan Lee created somethings that every single person and child knows today. 

Rest in peace and thank you for being the light-bearer and illuminating imagination in every child’s mind.
Stan had such a huge influence on my world back in the day. I’d say the bulk of my morality lessons came not from family, community or church, but from Spider-Man. Indirectly all those things informed me via Stan and other later writers, but the avenue that really reached me was comics. Rest well, and excelsior. 
Stan created my favorite superhero Spiderman, when I was old enough I got my first tattoo a silhouette of Spderman, many years later I saw a woman with a Spiderman tattoo, a few years after that she became my wife. Thank you Stan for making the world a brighter place. Excelsior!
His comics helped me through some very hard times in my life. Rest in peace Stan, you had a great cameo in mallrats

I would feel like "finally. Lawmakers taking the public's issues to heart."
I agree, and any ad for a auto service shop that plays squealing brakes or ominous engine sounds as well. 
Reddit, how do you feel about [common Reddit opinion]?

Edit: The fact that this is #3 for top of this year astounds me.

Also doorbells on commercials because my dogs.
I was driving one day and listening to a very popular radio station in my region. And I saw all cars around me on the highway swerve a little bit when a commercial with sirens came on. Very dangerous stuff if you ask me.

Edit: in the city close to where I live carnival is very popular and very well known, for about one month each year the festival gets their own radio station with loud obnoxious party music that is quite funny. Swerve is maybe an exaggeration but I saw the reaction of many drivers in my vicinity since the siren came on quite loud after the news bulletin.
I want to ban AskReddit posts about shit everyone will agree with 
You see this kind of question so often, everyone already agrees with the post anyway, it contributes nothing and is blatant karma whoring
Redditors, what are your thoughts on low hanging fruit Ask Reddit questions and diamonds and vaccines?
This is the most circle jerk post I’ve seen in a very long time
Reddit, do you think water is wet?
Oh fuck off i hate these posts, yes people want this, get out of here
I'd be fine with it.  Hell, I'd encourage the ban.  I flinch whenever those commercials are played.
This is a bad post. You’re asking a leading question that an overwhelmingly majority already agrees with. 

Reddit, how would you feel if we had hovercars that didn’t run on gas
/r/Shitpost
"Reddit, what's something you always bitch about and we all know the answer to, but I want a shitload of meaningless internet points?"
What about songs with those noises, will they get banned too?
I would prefer a law that bans asking this same question every week
Section 325(a) of the Communications Act, which states, in pertinent part:

No person within the jurisdiction of the United States shall knowingly utter or transmit, or cause to be uttered or transmitted, any false or fraudulent signals of distress, or communication relating thereto. . . .

https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/325

https://www.allaccess.com/fcc-uncensored/archive/5891/sirens-on-the-radio

It's already against the Federal Communications Act.  Contact the radio station, advertiser, etc citing this, and it will stop.
Almost no one will say no to this. Fishing for upvotes OP. How often is this an issue anyway
Why the fuck is this the top post of all time?
To be honest, I HATE these type of posts. Like is there anyone in the world who WOULDN'T be ok with a law like that? What kind of discussion is going to take place here other than people agreeing with it? This is literally a karma grab.
I don't think it's a big enough issue to waste time thinking about
Add babies crying to that list and I'll sign the petition.
I'd feel good about it. There are already laws about what can be said in broadcast and the loudness of ads vs. the main content.
I would feel it is a bad law.

This? This is the top most upvoted thread in AskReddit? A question no one in their right mind would ever disagree with?

You guys are weird.
"Reddit, how do you feel about (popular opinion)?
Yet another soapbox opinion worded in the form of a question to shoehorn it into this sub. 
Askreddit, how do you feel about banning this stupid type of "question"?
I was working as a stockboy in a supermarket and when we had to fill the milk cooler people would bust open a 12 pack of milk cartons and put them in one by one. 

On my first day I just placed the 12 pack in the cooler and cut the plastic off on one side with my box cutter and yanked it from under it and the look of the store manager and the other employee who was training me was pure bewilderment.

From that day everyone did it my way.
Start of lockdown, my 9 year old son was having worksheets emailed to complete at home. One day, left him at the laptop doing his maths while I made some dinner with my 3 year old daughter. Walked into the living room with his dinner to find him asking the Alexa all of his maths questions.
Worked as a laborer at a nursery one summer. Daily tasks included manually watering 15,000 plants each day. Put together a back of the napkin plan to build an irrigation system and spent the next few weeks building it with some money from the boss. That system is still running 15 years later and does all the work now. I did automate myself out of the job and had to find another eventually. 

Couple years later got my engineering degree. I’m convinced Engineers are inherently lazy people that will spend a disproportionate effort to make things easier.
My brother in law spent a whole summer trying to figure out how to fix his sagging deck at the lake which he could in theory crawl under and jack it up.

It would have been a tunneling project. It's a 60x60 area all long 2x6 boards. Massive. 

I sat there long enough with enough beers in me to come up with the idea of just cutting a square out of the sagging area about 3ft x 3ft, jacking it up then re-screwing down the boards.
He paints the thing every spring with a roller anyhow so it's not like the square cut shows up.

He thought I was a genius. 

I was just lazy.
We had to hold a thermometer in water in chemistry class. It probably was only 20 minute experiment but your arms get tired after a couple minutes and you can’t let the thermometer touch the bottom of the pan or it won’t get an accurate reading. So instead of sucking it up and just holding the thermometer, my lab partner built a contraption out of lab books and paperclips to somehow hold the thermometer in the water without it touching bottom.

It was the stupidest looking thing you would ever see in a lab class and our professor even walked over and said “if it looks stupid, sounds stupid, but it works, then it isn’t stupid.” My lab partner and I joke that he wasn’t talking about the contraption but the intellect of my lab partner
I had a math teacher that actively encouraged his students to be as lazy as possible, defining lazy as actively searching for ways to do as minimal work as possible. His logic was that, the way math is now, it could always be simplified and still work the same, someone just needs to be lazy enough to find that.
I was a (paid) intern at a large company during one summer back home from college.

My work 95% consisted of using SAP, import to Excel, clean data and generate reports (occasionally create some tool someone needed). In the 1st 2 weeks after getting a hang of my responsibilities, writing all the Excel formulas needed, and basically automating 99% of my work, I was chilling.

I went from actually working from 9-5 to maybe 1 hour tops a day. Finding, importing, cleaning, and reporting usually took hours but with all the formulas it took 2 minutes of clicking. I then helped the other cool intern get his shit set up so we could both just chill. We could take 2-hour lunches (paid for by the company) and nobody said anything cause we were just getting so much more done than the other interns. Ofc I helped for special tasks when asked but those were simple 20min tasks building something in Excel.

Overall, was the easiest/stress-less internship of my life.
The clerk was asked to bring 145 white papers into the office. He doesn't want to count the papers manually so he printed 145 blank sheets and took them in.
One of my favorite examples is Andy Kim. And I'd like to preface this by saying that I don't think Kim is lazy so much as a genius.

Andrew Youakim was a singer/songwriter who became famous under the stage name Andy Kim. He achieved success writting songs for bands like the Archies, possibly most notably "Sugar, Sugar." After his success he coasted for awhile until his record label dropped him for lack of output. At that point he created his own  label and cranked out hits like "Rock Me Gently." When they saw this, the big record labels then bought his label under the assumption that they would then profit off of the songs he wrote and performed.

He then very shortly stopped writing songs and largely lived off the sale of his label.

Work smarter not harder.
It took me like 3 months, but I automated a data pipeline to extract data, clean it up, and spit it out in an excel or pdf format to one of our clients.

I walked over to shoot the shit with the lady who handles my client and gives me tasks and she told me we make 40k off them every month for that automated job.

Fuck, I need to go start my own business.
When  Carl Friedrich Gauss, the famous German mathematician and physicist was in elementary school (around 1784), his class was assigned the "busy work" task of adding all the numbers from 1 to 100 (1+2+3+4, and so on). This usually kept the class quiet for half an hour or so. Seven year-old Carl  was sitting quietly with the correct answer (5050) while the rest of the class was just starting, so the surprised teacher asked him how he came up with the solution. He replied that he added 1 and 100 and got 101. Then he added 2 and 99, and got 101, 3 plus 98 = 101, and so on. He realized there was a pattern of 50 pairs of numbers with each pair adding up to 101. And 50 x 101 = 5050.
When I was in college I had a job at an Italian fast food place with a reputation for it's breadsticks.
They came in frozen and needed a bit to thaw, so we'd take a giant 3x4ft aluminum baking sheet, spread them out in a single layer with no spaces and cover it with a plastic bag, then leave it sit in the walk-in overnight. The next day you'd have to get a pair of tongs and move each stick to a new tray, turning them over, then cover the new tray with the bag and let them sit on racks for a couple of hours before brushing on the garlic butter sauce. This was tedious enough that you'd usually be ready to brush the butter on the first tray as soon as you turned the last tray.
I was given this task for the first time one morning and just did not want to deal with it. I realized if I put the second tray upside down on top of the first one then turned it over and took the first tray out, I got exactly the same results. Blew the boss's mind when I did the 3 hour job in about 15 minutes. 
I was given a $0.05/hour raise.
I was once set to test a certain piece of equipment on a ship. The test involved attaching the unit to a reader, then run loads of command line commands. Then, one would have to make a copy of all the text, copy it into word and save it as a (real crappy looking) report. There was HUNDREDS of units, and they needed to be testet several times a year. We did about 20-30 a day. It would take several weeks to finish. 

I didn't know coding at the time, but always wanted to learn it.

Within two months, I had made a program, even with a GUI (to spot faults with ease, instead of having to actually READ the reports). The program could read three units at a time, and would automatically create a smooth pdf report and save it on our server, named with serial number and date.

The job was now to attach three units, then wait for about 3 minutes, detach and attach new ones. Basically 30 seconds work, 3 minutes break. I could now test all units in a day, though I would typically spread it out over a couple more days.

When I left the company, I left the program on the test computer. I got an email from an ex colleague a few months later, saying they were using the program on several ships now. There wasn't any manual for the program, of course, but it was so straight forward that it wasn't needed.
>If I need directions I'm not asking a man with one tooth, I'm asking a man with one leg. Cause he definitely knows the easiest way to get there. Yup, if there's a shortcut that one legged fucker knows where it is. You won't be hoppin' fences neither.
I plug clocks in at midnight so they're already set.

An older company had a person dedicated to “data entry” which boiled down to copying and pasting portions of data from text files into spreadsheet and formatting into a report. 

The person originally doing this job spent a full 40+ hours/week doing it, but was not very computer literate. When they retired, the company hired someone with actual skills. The new hire convinced management to let her work remotely after getting up to speed on the job. 

The first week at home was spent automating the entire job. The remainder of their multi-year tenure with the company was spent doing whatever they wanted save the 10-15 minutes weekly to run their program and to answer the odd email here and there. All while getting paid full salary and benefits. They actually had to add in a few errors now and then to make it seem realistic.
Worked in a local adult education center. One of my main tasks was to make calculation about how many people enlisted for a course, how many of them got discounts (unemployeds e.g.), how many men/women/age etc. That was needed to calculate upcoming courses fees etc. That was my only work there and I hated it.

This was in early 90s, so PCs were a thing in our offices but I had no idea how to write a program or use a database to use this informations. Lucky as I am our center had an interesting policy: when you want to educate yourself, you can attend that class for free. And when it's during the worktime, then this is worktime - as long as my supervisor is ok with that. She was.

So I spent 3 months "studying" database structures, scripting, coding etc. I told my tutor what I wanna do and he helped me to write a script that grabs all necessary informations from the courses-database, copy that into another database and then I went crazy and wrote code that was insane. I implemented "what if" scenarios thanks to filters. At the end I was able to do my work, that needed 6hrs a day within 15 minuntes. I mean, before that it took e.g. an hour to have all the necessary informations to have a "how many unemployed single parent women does it need to make the costs of that course even. I had EVERYTHING back then. Now you want statistics how many single parent disabled foreign women at the age of 80-90 are needed for the next 2 years to keep the ornithology course running? Sure, no problem. Clickety-Click, done.

After that, I started the PC in the morning, grabbed all the data, ran my script, was done within 15 mins and then read the book I brought from home. At the end of the day I gave my supervisor several dozens of papers, statistics, predictions etc and said "That was a lot of work!!" and went home. My supervisor was superhappy with me because I did so much more now and was super-effective.
I worked 'goods in' for an aircraft manufacturer as a summer job at university. Parts would arrive, we'd open them and key in all the details into a terminal. That bit was long winded. I discovered the terminal keyboard has assignable shortcuts, and set up a bunch of them for all the boilerplate such that keying in an item was about six keystrokes. Saved myself and my workmate hours every day, which we would spend pranking each other, other warehouse staff and staff at other sites.
I had a manager in my twenties who detested the fact I turned a two hour process into a fifteen minute process.  It exposed how much lazier he was compared to me because when the higher ups learned from other people at my level that I created the program, they took me aside and told me he took credit for it.  They asked me how I felt about that.

I told them what decisions they make regarding the manager's character is their decision.  Just put yourselves in my shoes and consider it from that angle.

They did nothing and I took the concept to a competitor who invested the money into making the program more robust and proprietary.  My name was line one on the patent and trademark documents and I did well enough to semi-retire at 45.

I credit Lee Iacocca for the inspiration.  He went through a similar problem with higher ups at Ford and his answer was to take his brain to Chrysler who would value it.
Back in highschool a lot of kids used to walk thru his park to get home/to school. A portion of the path went into the woods because it was just quicker than walking the actual trail.  At one point in the walk through the woods,  you had to go up this small but tedious hill; nothing major but it took like 10 seconds of hard work to go up it.  You couldn’t go around because one side was a small cliff to the creek below and other side had dense trees.  One summer, a bunch of us got together and decided to just dig through that hill to make it flat.  It took like 14 of us 3 good days to get through it.  

It was a hard 3 days but it was definitely worth it. Saved 10 second of hill climbing every morning and afternoon, 150+ days of the year. And it wasn’t just us, but hundreds of other kids who took the same party every day. Sometimes you need to put in a lot of work so your future selves can enjoy the easy way out.
I was invited to my friend’s yearly apple picking: it was a full day of apples and kids and filling a truck for cider.  I’m lazy and suggested we make the process more efficient with tarps on the ground.  We managed in 2 hours what historically took all day.  We didn’t even get to the picnic lunch.  Essentially, I ruined apple picking
Walkie Talkie's. In every job I've ever had these things make your day far less labor intensive if used correctly.

In Australia explorers discovered a mountain that was taller than Mt Kosciuszko, which was though to be the tallest mountain in Australia. Rather then cause confusion by telling everyone a new tallest mountain had been found, they simply named the new mountain Mt Kosciuszko and renamed the original to something else.
Sounds like Hanlon's Razor.   [https://fs.blog/2017/04/mental-model-hanlons-razor/](https://fs.blog/2017/04/mental-model-hanlons-razor/) 

 

The German general [Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_von_Hammerstein-Equord) used Hanlon’s razor to assess his men, saying:

>I divide my officers into four groups. There are clever, diligent, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent – their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy – they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent – he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.
I have a massive exercise to do at our year end (accountancy). My work previously got checked by another manager who spent over 3 weeks going over the data. Eventually she got shifted to another department and that workload fell on me, basically self audit and then present the data to the actual auditors.
My previous manager was absolutely shit at Excel. I didn't let on but I did all the audit on a separate file using simple (but out of the way) formulas. Not only did I reduce the task from 3 weeks to basically real time checks (no time) but when I was told that I have to perform that exercise every month my job became a doddle. I didn't let on that everything was automated by sumifs, indexing, max values and range checks.
Living the dream. (Sorry if I rambled on.)
At work, I go through parts and apply 2 different kinds or tape and 2 different kinds of weave. I have finally got the rhythm down and now I do each part individually, and apply everything at once. Everyone else goes through an entire order, just applying tape, then goes through it again to do the weave. 

I asked to use the *big* table in the back of the shop, and just put all the tape and weave tools there. And do the parts all at once. Normal rate for an 8hr shift is 1200, but I can manage 1800 in a day, going at a nice steady pace. 

Edit: I *can* get 1800 going at a steady pace. I've done it before. But I usually dont. Most days I go slow and relax, purposely only making 1300-1350 or so parts. It's just enough over rate to get my incentive bonus. 

And, thanks to being a "hard and fast" worker, the uppers leave me alone at my big table in the back. They look the other way when I have an earbud in one ear, and they don't notice that I scroll reddit or read a lot.

Edit: I can't say what products we make, they're too recognizable and googling it would reveal where I work and live.
I knew a guy who had a low level data/reporting job. He had several daily/weekly work responsibilities, including a bunch of reports that needed quite a bit of tweaking from raw data to finished product. But like I said, low level.

We didn't find out until way later, but he had set up macros for each of his major responsibilities where he could. Once set up, he'd just run the macros to do his work, but then he'd (smartly) hold off on delivering the reports until just a little before the deadlines. 

He'd hit every assignment and was seen as reliable. He also would complain about the workload so people would leave him with that work. I doubt he did a full hour of work a day after he set up what he did.

Eventually he left the job for one with better pay. But damn did he work lazy. Also, he was smart not to reveal until the end, because had he told them about it he would have gotten a pat on the back and would have been given a whole other workload, on top of maintaining those macros/etc. Dude milked the job, not the other way around.
One of my favorite stories from my youth was "[The Tale of the Man Who Was Too Lazy to Fail"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_for_Love#%22The_Tale_of_the_Man_Who_Was_Too_Lazy_to_Fail%22). 

I got fed-up with hand writing itemized sub-orders at work, so I set up a spreadsheet that you can just fill out. Then I got tired of having more than one program open, and not being able to search within & among those order sheets (at least not automatically, or easily), so I'm having our FileMaker guy integrate it into our greater ordering & invoicing system.

I was frustrated at the pointlessness of sorting a giant pile of paper invoices from an unpaid stack to a paid stack every month, so I just use the accounting software to keep track.

I became *so irritated* with having to fill out a multi-page, printed spreadsheet for every single order (sometimes just one item, two pages in [and frequently, there would be those pesky itemized sub orders]) that I condensed the items into "most used", put them  all on one easy to read sheet, and encouraged my co-worker to simply write out the more uncommon items at the bottom.

Basically, I hate busy work, and paper invariably leads to busy work. I have tried to reduce the use of paper in our office, but have not been entirely successful. 

We have to have written order forms available (because sometimes the orders are coming in too fast to be able to type it all quickly & correctly), and have to keep some paper records for things like Organic, FDA, and USDA audits - but all in all I'd say my absolute hatred of filing has reduced busywork here by at least half.
Me. I automate shit all the time at work to make daily routine jobs more easy. I write manuals with screenshots with arrows indicating where to click or where to fill in what. Whenever I write a manual, I assume that whoever reads it is a complete idiot so that whenever customers call for the same questions again, I just send them to the online manual I created. No need to type it  out again by email or explain it again by phone.

Does Alexander and the Gordian Knot count?

"A complex knot that, according to prophecy, was to be undone only by the person who was to rule Asia, and that was cut, rather than untied, by Alexander the Great."
My boss put my name in for leading a project group shortly after I joined the company. I had no experience whatsoever about project managing yet he still demanded that I lead the group of 12 people. 

All way smarter guys (tech background and shit, these guys are like magicians for me) and with way more time at the company. 

I’m a business guy who’s too dumb for balance sheets that’s why I’m in HR (and because I quite like the field the most). 

So we started the first meeting, I asked for everyone’s plan, experience and ideas, gathered the different pros and cons, cross checked with the budget we had, put on a time frame with milestones to reach (around 6 months), put in valuable people to consult at different steps. Why did I do that? Because I like organizing stuff and keep everyone on the same page and delegate to-dos. 

Got promoted because of the success of the project. 

I asked my boss why he put me in for it since I never done anything like that. He said because I complained in the first week that most of the work has way too wonky structure, no clear guideline and this could be improved heavily if we just take some time into it. And because I hated talking to others if I had questions and I wouldn’t get a clear answer (like: ask 10 people the same question and you get 15 different answers). In the long run this would make us way more efficient and keeps everyone on the same page. 

All because I hated disorganized work.
Years ago as a student I got a job stocking shelves.  Guys were carrying the heavy boxes, put them on the floor and bend each time to pick up the items to put on the shelves.  I was maybe a light 100 pounds (woman) and carrying the boxes was just killing me physically.  So one day I had an idea.  I put the box on a old desk chair and rolled it around.  No more carrying and no more bending!   Funny thing is that, instead of doing the same thing, most of the guys called me lazy and kept carrying the heavy boxes.  Just to prove how strong they were.

Now they have special rolling carts to do the job.
The entire micellaneous kitchen tools section at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I don't need an avocado slicer or a lemon squeezer or an automatic chopper/dicer, but lazy old me definitely puts them to good use.
This is a case of ask a lazy person for a solution to handling their work;

I got sent out to California on a fact finding mission about the marijuana growing industry (years ago) to see if there was a market for the sort of A&C work we do (automation & controls).I set up meetings with some of the local growers and met with them, discussed their outdoor grow operations.

Their biggest complaint was having to go to the grow sites to do various tasks associated with maintaining the crop.

I asked them; "If we could provide a system that could allow you to manage those operations remotely from home, would you be interested in buying it?"

Every single guy was like "fuck yeah, if I can do it from bed while smoking a spliff I'd be totally on board for that, that's like my dream come true!"

So it turns out some of the automation that was developed for that industry was marketed to the inherent laziness of stoners who have an entrepreneurial spirit.
My brother gave  my oldest nephew 10 dollars a week if he did all his chores with out needing to be told or complaining.

One day he gets home early from work and sees. The neighbor kid tossing a bag in the trash.   He asks him what he is doing and the kid says he gets 5 bucks a week to take care of a few chores.


My nephew outsourced his chores.
Well I worked in a Graphics design studio as an intern. They mostly had me practice and do some basic stuff their head designers was to busy to do.

One was a real estate add. It had a few basic templates, but it was all kinds of scatterbrained. I would spend 5-10 minutes trying to find the right layer for all the pictures, and had to mess with way too much.

So I made copies of the files, and made one for each template. I labeled everything, made it so the images on top of each other wouldn’t clip into the lower ones like the previous did.. so on.. you could be in and out of the template in 2-3 minutes. Showed my boss the difference, and he had this face of “well shit..” he said the next day that if I was a graduate he’d hire me, because I was better than the people sending applications in. 

In short I made an overly complicated/unorganized thing the opposite, and my boss was actually sad he couldn’t hire me.
I had to carry groceries into the house when I was a kid. I didn’t want to make multiple trips, so I tied several bags to the belt loops on my pants to do it in one trip.
I'm doing it right now, automated data cleaning in Python. My coworkers don't know about it, so something that takes me 10 mins at most takes them 2 hours.

Edit. For everyone who says I should share my code, I have. I even set up a private GitHub space for my team. Some have taken it up, but others (including management) do not like it. I think they feel a little threatened.
I worked for the State doing data entry of a sort - we got scans of forms that people had filled out, and we had to go through and make sure the numbers that the computer had pulled from the scan matched what was written, since it wasn't entirely accurate.

so, the software we used showed us all the scanned documents, and overlaid fields right next to any point where the scanner found numbers, with the number the machine determined was written already in the field. the job was essentially looking at each field and making sure the number right next to it was the same - if it wasn't, fix it. we didn't fuck with any of the text, it was just the numbers.

now, these scans included ALL of the paperwork submitted by each person, including like a dozen pages with no data whatsoever, it was just the beginning of the document that the person read before they filled out the actual forms and stuff. there was also a section just after the middle that was several more pages of information for the person.

my trainer showed me how to do all this - he accepted a new document from the queue, and pressed the down arrow key to scroll through the beginning section until he got to the first field. he made sure the numbers matched and repeated this process for several minutes, before excusing himself and telling me I could come grab him if I had any questions.

I sat down at the computer, and took a look around the room. literally every screen I could see from where I was sitting, people were actively scrolling. some were using mousewheel, most used the down arrow.

I accepted a new document from the queue, and I pushed the tab button. the program instantly brought me to the first field a dozen pages down. I smirked to myself, compared the field to the written text, and repeated THAT process instead. I **did** go back and scroll through that first document to ensure I hadn't missed anything due to a goof in the software or anything like that.

near the end of my second day, I was called into my bosses' office and asked what I'd been doing the past two days. turns out, as of day two, I was churning through five or six times the amount of documents a day compared to people who'd been working there for years. my boss assumed I was just clicking through new documents without doing any work and was very much acting like he had caught me red-handed.

I asked if they reviewed the documents I finished to ensure that I'd done the work. he replied that they hadn't, but, it was obviously impossible to go through that many pages in the time it took me to do it. I told him that I knew for a fact that if he went through any of my work, he'd see everything was fine.

he pulled one of my finished documents at random, and spent several minutes scrolling through it, shaking his head to himself, staring daggers at the screen. he admitted that this document was fine, but, it would take hours for his assistant manager to review all my work.

"Can I show you something? Could you please pull up another random document of mine?"

he rolled his eyes, but, he did it. I stood up from my chair, came around the desk, and I hit tab. he was looking at the screen like it was witchcraft, I showed him the field matched, and tabbed my way through the rest of the fields, confirming the rest of the numbers as I did. I finished reviewing the whole document with him in less than a minute.

he asked me if my trainer showed me that. I replied that he hadn't, but, it was a universal keyboard shortcut that I'd been using since the early 90's - this happened in 2013, btw.

he just looked at me for a bit, and then said he had to talk to his assistant manager about the whole thing, before asking me to go back to work.

later, I'm heading out at the end of the day when my boss asks me to come over to his office. he fires me for "not taking the job seriously" and "potentially causing delays to taxpayers due to inaccuracies." I actually laughed at him after he got done with his spiel.

...and that's the story of how I managed to flummox several state employees with a highly controversial use of the tab button. still blows my mind.
A few years back my sister was doing some hardware testing and validation. She was working with a bunch of excel tables. When she found out that I was doing some automatic xls creating/editing for my job she had me create a script for her job.

2-3 days of eye-killing boring work done in 20 seconds.

She kept it a secret for a while. The worst task became the best task.

She eventually shared it with the company as there were many others that did a similar job. And then she got promoted.

In conclusion her lazynes helped with her promotion
According to facebook parents: the fucker that carved a sphere out of a stone block and rolled it instead of pushing it like the other dudes...

An engineer spent hours developing a program so they could start the coffee pot from their desk and not have to wait for coffee when arriving in the break room.
My ex-boss gave me an excel sheet. 124.000 rows excel sheet. Had all the company customer data per row - twice. In some of those duplicates there was an error. 
She needed me to go over the list one row by row to check for mistakes and mark all the faulty entries I could find. Through 124.000 rows. She wanted me to do that using the arrow-down key and my mouse. 

I thanked her. I sat down. Invested half an hour into Google. Copy pasted some parts of this formula, then some parts of that. Finally I had figured out the formula. 
I double clicked the tiny rectangle so that the formula gets applied on all rows. 
Worked like a charm. 

I stood up, got myself a coffee, talked to some colleagues. Then I went to my boss. 
She had anticipated that I would need 3 days for this task. When I was back less than an hour later, she thought I hadn't understood the task or maybe a follow up question. 

I will never forget the expression on her face when I told her I was done. There were 6 faulty entries. 

(A year and a half later I enrolled into computer science at university where I will finish my undergrad this summer :> )
There's a [repo on Github](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts) containing code based on scripts that were used by a tech employee that his coworkers discovered after he left the company. Here's a summary of his shenanigans:

Edit: repo code is based on the story, not actually from this person

>xxx: OK, so, our build engineer has left for another company. The dude was literally living inside the terminal. You know, that type of a guy who loves Vim, creates diagrams in Dot and writes wiki-posts in Markdown... If something - anything - requires more than 90 seconds of his time, he writes a script to automate that.  

>xxx: So we're sitting here, looking through his, uhm, "legacy"  

>xxx: You're gonna love this  

>xxx: [smack-my-bitch-up.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/smack-my-bitch-up.sh) \- sends a text message "late at work" to his wife (apparently). Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.  

>xxx: [kumar-asshole.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/kumar-asshole.sh) \- scans the inbox for emails from "Kumar" (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like "help", "trouble", "sorry" etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply "no worries mate, be careful next time".  

>xxx: [hangover.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/hangover.sh) \- another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like "not feeling well/gonna work from home" etc. Adds a random "reason" from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.  

>xxx: (and the oscar goes to) [fucking-coffee.sh](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts/blob/master/fucking-coffee.sh) \- this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens a telnet session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has a TCP socket up and running) and sends something like sys brew. Turns out this thing starts brewing a mid-sized half-caf latte and waits another 24 (!) seconds before pouring it into a cup. The timing is exactly how long it takes to walk to the machine from the dudes desk.  

>xxx: holy sh\*t I'm keeping those
I don't know if this is a true story, but kind of fits your request. 

There was a manufacturing plant that made toothpaste. One year for some reason there ended up being an unusually high number of empty boxes being shipped out. So in order to stop that from happening the head of the company hired a couple engineers to develope a system to catch any empty boxes so they didn't get shipped with the boxes that actually had the toothpaste tubes in them.

The engineers developed a system that if the box weighed below a certain amount the system would stop and a worker would have to go remove the box and start everything up again. The person in charge loved the idea and implemented it immediately. And right from the get go the number of empty boxes shipped dropped to near zero. 

The head of the company wanted to go see the system in action so he goes and visits the plant one day and notices a huge fan right by the assembly line. Very confused as it wasn't hot he asked the plant manager why the fan was there. The plant manager said the workers were tired of stopping what they were doing to remove an empty box so they just hooked up a fan to blow the empty boxes off the scale before the system recognized it was empty and shut everything off.

So laziness led to a more efficient (and cost effective) plan.


Every year in the Canadian winter, powerlines would fail due to the weight of the snow. It took many days to build up enough to break a line so they employed a team to walk the routes and shake the poles to loosen the snow.

One day they saw a bear shaking the poles and realized that if they could get the bear to do it they wouldn't need to walk the route.

So they gave one guy a bucket of honey and he'd walk the route painting the sides of the poles with honey to attract the bears. It worked for a few more years But this still takes a lot of time to do.

So then they had the idea of flying a helicopter along the route with a trained sniper with honey paintballs that he'd shoot the poles with.

On its maiden flight the helicopter passed the lines and the downdraft blew away all of the snow.

The flights continue to this day but without the sniper.

My greenhouse's watering system. 

I would spend an hour per day watering the garden. 30 hours per month.

So for $50, I setup a PVC watering system in a few hours. Now I just turn on the spigot and watch while I smoke a joint.
the guy that fixed the track link problem on russian t-34 tanks. instead of redesigning the tracks or track links he slapped some metal at the side of the tank for the links to get pushed back into place.
Programming away work *is* the real life example of this.
I worked with a guy, Ethan, who unfortunately was kind of scapegoated for the failure of a project so was let go but he was definitely capable.  A year later the company I worked for was sold off and eventually shuttered.  While looking for new work I spoke with a recruiter who had also worked with the Ethan and he mentioned how he got was trying to find him a new position too as he had a contract job to digitize and update old mechanical drawings to the companies new software.  Apparently he wrote a bunch of macros and set up a work flow and was able to complete the work within a month even though the contract was for 6 months.  The company let him go since the work was done and had no intentions of keeping him on.
My wife and I have a chore list. I now am tasked with vacuuming which she gloated about not having to do because it is so time consuming. I bought a Roomba and now the house is cleaner than ever and all I have to do is press a button on my phone.
Polymerase Chain Reaction. PCR changed bio and medical sciences more than any other breakthrough in modern times and it came about because a scientist wanted to surf more so he figured out how to do a full-time lab job in just a few hours a week. Love him.

I mean the original quote was made by Frank B. Gilbreth after watching "lazy" brick layers move more efficiently, so...that.
In construction environments it's quite common to have a "soft" foreman/men underneath the actually person in charge. You basically find the individuals you know want to work their way up and give them components of the work and however many people they need - they'll do it because often times it means less physical work for them. You're still ultimately signing off on their work or settling debates/etc. which makes you the ultimate foreman or supervisor, but you know that you can assigned the task and they'll let you know when it's done and everyone is keeping the schedule in mind.
I used to work in IT doing tech support for the employees. We didn't have a process for keeping track of what programs and hardware each employee PC used. 

So if someone had to replace a PC you had to remote into their old one to get their programs, shared folders, and hardware. If their old PC died you had to hope they knew what they needed.

I made an easy single page sheet to track the user, the PC specs, programs, and hardware they use. Now you just need to copy what is on the sheet when setting up a new computer
Programming. A lazy programmer will think all the possible ways of doing a single simple task
I remember reading about a Texas airport that had a high rate of complaints from people who had to wait a long time for their luggage at baggage claim. The solution: Assign a further away Baggage claim for the same flights. People walked longer, but complaints went way down since they didn't have to wait as long.
I asked my husband to take out roughly a dumpsters worth of trash. He spent about an hour building a sled out of the trash, and took it out in one go.

Laziest man I've ever met
I created mainframe automation so that if there was a problem, I would get paged in my boss’s office where I played DOOM for hours on end. Oh and browsed newsgroups. Yes, I’m old.
IT department.

Sure I could do that thing, or I could write a script and get it automated.
I worked in a library scanning incoming books into the system. This required a lot of transferring of piles of books from one station to another. My work mate constantly called me lazy because I would not get out of my chair while doing this job. I don't know how many times I had to explain (a) that's what wheely chairs are for, and (b) I was at least three times as fast as her at the same job and this was in part because of the efficiency of not getting up out of my chair every two minutes.
I am presently printing and wiring a safety switch that will disable my lathe when the chuck key is removed. It is a rule that the chuck key will never be in the chuck whilst any other activity is occurring other than tightening the chuck. Whilst I have never yet forgotten to remove the key, I decided that to ensure it is never left in the chuck, the machine will never start with the key removed from the switch.
Back in my IT consulting days working at an MSP, we had a client with about 180 users who needed new PC's prepped and ready to go for a round of new hires when they were expanding their workforce.  They were adding 40 employees and thus needed 40 workstations prepped. I was assigned the ticket and my boss quoted them 80 hours of work (2h per PC).

The standard procedure my boss had set up back then was a 3 page checklist to run through for each PC, what software was needed for which group, reminders for installing update s since Dell workstations out of the box aren't always current with updates, and more. Basically it was a terribly long, arduous, manual approach to windows deployment. 

So instead of  following the standard procedure, I decided I was going to automate it all. The first 2 days unboxed 1 PC, prepped it with all the basic items needed for all workstations and then cloned it to another PC. Day 3 I built off of the first image i created which had some more specialized software for a specific subgroup of these new hires. Once that was complete, I was ready to deploy. 

I configured the 'WDS' (Windows deployment server) role and had everything ready to go. I brought in a 24 port switch, hooked all PC's up for 2 rounds of 20 deployments, and on day 4, by lunch, I had all workstations complete. All the while my bosses kept checking in to see what was up and why I only had 2 PCs prepped as of the end of day 3. After lunch on day 4, I called to check in and informed them the job was complete. Their response was  to have me just hang out at the clients office for the next week or so which gave me a decent amount of downtime back then to work on things I wanted to.
Did you really say that, /u/thisisbillgates?
Me. I am a real life example of this. 
"Wow you do amazing work you must work so hard!"
Fuck no! Step 1 of any new job/task is work flow efficiency. 
But I let them continue to think I'm busting my ass while I surf reddit.

My friend applied for a job at company that works on autonomously driving systems for cars. During the interview he was asked whether likes cars. His answer was that he absolutely hates to drive. He got the job.
Me, one time I asked my boss "seriously, why do you always toss me the difficult tasks?" and he replied "because I know you'll get it done quick so you can get your ass back on reddit"
When Peter the Great was building St Petersburg there was a huge boulder needed removing as it was in the way of a road.  Lots of contractors tendered for the job. The would use explosives to start, smash it into smaller pieces using sledgehammers and then cart them away.
A local peasant also put in an offer for half the price.
They gave him the job. He and a few friends dug a large hole next to it, took away the excess earth, tipped the boulder in and covered it up with the remaining earth.
I used to animate graphics for those LED signs at certain popular fast food chains. There would sometimes be a library of 80-120 6 second videos that need resized or scaled down. 

I figured out how to make a system macro that memorize some of my mouse clicks and keyboard strokes and it automated a previously 4 hour task into something I could hit one button and start sketching out ideas for other projects.
Before it was shut down entirely, I was able to privately tour the coal power plant in Southeastern Virginia. At one point in the tour, the guide told me to watch out for a cord on the floor. The cord ran to a small, window air-conditioning unit that was duct-taped to a vent. Supposedly, one day the plant began to overheat, and the plant would have to be shut down in order to repair the malfunction. There are emergency reserves for situations like this, but the plant was overheating faster than they could switch it over. Someone at the plant had just purchased the ac unit, and had it in the back of their vehicle. The ran and grabbed it, plugged it in, and pointed it into one of the vents. The amount of cool air it produced was enough to not only offset the overheating, but to also re-regulate the system, so instead of repairing the issue, they just fixed the the ac in place, and let it run continuously until the day the plant shut down.
At my last job, a truck suspension shop, we did inventory every December and it was someone's job to count all the washers and screws of every size.

It was my first inventory and I casually mentioned that they should just weigh 10 screws or washers, then weigh them all and divide the weight to get the count. Everyone looked at me like I had given them the key to the universe.

Counting washers and screws went from a day or two, to just a an hour.
IT is the king of this.  We have set up scripts to do tons of tasks for reporting and data manipulation automatically.  We have been using one macro program for years that works flawless most of the time.  It can recognize windows and screens and you can tell it to do about anything.  Its called Macro Express.  Way back in the days when Farmville was big on facebook, you had to harvest these fields, and if you found a pineapple field, you could make bank. It was a grid of squares and you had to click each square to harvest it, and sometimes other players would jump in and start harvesting too.  I wrote a macro on a hot key that when i found a full field to harvest, it would take the mouse cursor, move and click every single square in the grid, so once it was claimed, no one else could harvest it.  It would click the entire grid in about 5 seconds, where if you were doing it manually, it would take you about 30 seconds.  I've also used it for voting websites before they implemented measures to only allow one vote per IP address.  You can do all sorts of things if you want to put in the time to perfect your script.
Basically every invention in the last 100 years is an example of how to accomplish a task with much less effort. The automobile being the first one that comes to mind.
I personally use the "talk-to-text" feature on my phone to get it to write essays for me... I just talk about what I want it to write and then tweak the grammar errors later. Work smarter, not harder😊
I use to work at car dealership parts department and most repetitively strokes for the same product like oil changes and such. Made a keystroke shortcut. 

Now as a forklift driver at a Costco I try to make sure there is something alwys on my forks going in or out of aisle. 
Unlike other drivers they don’t. That common sense though.
Im glad people like me have value in this world, i would have never known otherwise
A computer algorithm arranged my work driving route. It looked at physical location on a grid without considering roads, rivers, etc. Just direct distance. It was godawful, lots of unnecessary cul-de-sacing, stuck on one-way trips with a ton of deadhead travel back, etc. There was no rhyme or reason, a giant looping circuitous mess that drove past stops, returning to them later, and doubling back everywhere.

I spent the first weekend redoing it by hand, specifically to make it as efficient as possible so I can relax between stops to talk to clients casually or just sit in parking lots and do fuck all. Before the pandemic added a bunch of new stops, I would take all the time I needed, a long lunch break, and still always made it to drop off ahead of schedule.

I'm exceptionally lazy. Past me did an hour of work on Google maps to save me hours and hours over the last two years.
SPL in Scouts, doing a trail clean up. Quite a large amount of larger limbs, thinner trunks. Like eye aspens or w/e they’re called. 

We had a big boi, even for a teen, talking over 6ft and over 200 at the least. He was the type to only carry one thing but use two hands because he was self pronounced as lazy..

Put him on the assignment of limb and trunk removal. He used a timber hitch, and would clear the trail 3-4 limbs or trunks at a time. He loved it because he “just had to tie a knot and walk...” and freed up like 3 more scouts for other work

We made great pace.
In my teens I started working at a local grocery store and was hired in the Deli/Bakery Dept. Every morning 1 person made salads, 2 people brewed the fresh gallon sweet tea and 2 people created/prepped the deli counter ready-to-go meals. One week we had a bad flu case hit us and we were severely short on staff. 

I grabbed a grocery cart and started brewing tea. While it brewed I made the salads. Instead of taking each gallon tea to the other side of the store 1 at a time I would place them in the grocery cart and continue brewing and stacking till the cart was full (Because fuck walking back and forth). Usually by the time it was full I was finished with all morning prep and was able to help the cook make breakfast and prep for lunch. The manager saw this and turned it into my full job in the morning. Unfortunately for my co-workers most were then 'let go'. I only knew of 1 who was lucky enough to be moved to another job in the store. I ended up leaving shortly after due to the backlash.

TLDR; I did the job equivalent of 5 people by being able to multi-task with only a shopping cart and accidentally ruining others jobs.
When I was about 7-10 years old my dad used to pay me to ‘self sit.’ Basically instead of having to get a baby sitter on short notice and then pay them like $100, he told me that I would get $30 if I stayed in my room and didn’t speak to my older sister for 3 hours. He then told my sister that she was the “baby sitter” and she would get $30 if nothing bad happened
  In 1927 my grandfather started his new job at Dupont on a Friday.  His first assignment was to separate out a chemical that was suspended in another chemical.  He was handed a beaker of the stuff to work on.  Since it was late on a Friday afternoon, he did nothing with it, just stuck it on a shelf and went home.
  He came back Monday morning to discover that the chemical had precipitated out and was sitting on the bottom of the beaker.  He showed this to his new boss, who decided my grandfather was a genius.  This process (doing nothing to the suspension) became the first of my grandfather's 47 patents.
My girlfriend will kill me for this but fuck it.  I hate taking a finished toilet paper roll downstairs to throw it out.  Me just leaving the empty roll in the bathroom annoys the crap out of my girlfriend so I developed this strategy when there was only a few sheets left, I'd start using sheets from a new roll and leave the old roll with sheets still on it.  That way, she'd always be the one to finish the roll and have to take the empty one downstairs.

Edit: For people asking why I don't just use the bathroom rubbish bin, we recycle our cardboard.
I work at a company which, despite having a 100+ employees, doesn't seem to have 1 that knows more then basics when it comes to computers.   
Due to the pandemic we've all taken up some chores to clock some hours. They've got me "re-typing" pdf read only files to a new word file. Thus far they havent figured out you can just export a pdf file to .doc in acrobat. But my schedule is now 1/3 cleared to do "typing" work.

Not entirely what you're looking for, but there was a guy who outsourced his entire job to China. He showed up to work and had a very tight schedule of reddit, facebook, and ebay: https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/01/16/169528579/outsourced-employee-sends-own-job-to-china-surfs-web
The way Linux went about protecting accounts from brute force guessing passwords. Since those attacks rely on trying a gazillion passwords, they just added a delay between each try. Effectively limiting the number of differents passwords you can try in a reasonable time frame.

Since then it's the de facto way of going about it.
Years ago while working at my uncle's warehouse there was a monthly shipment of double doors with the frame built in. These doors were so heavy that it was a five to six man job to get them off the truck and walking them though a narrow enough hallway; this process could kill 2 hours of sales because the place had a crew of ten men and with 6 being needed it was known to avoid shopping there on those days. 

Have no idea how long they did this but on the second shipment when I started; I got one of those rolling boards that mechanics use to go under cars and told the guys to place it on top. 

I turned a 6 man job with 2 hours to a 2 man job that took 30 mins.

That’s the premise of hitchhikers guide to the galaxy except for the waiting for us to figure it out part
I mean we could always just be cosmic ants.

How often do you go out to your garden and try to communicate with the bugs?
So...the prime directive?
What if aliens showed up here millions of years ago, saw a planet inhabited buy enormous lizard monsters and said fuck that, dont come back to this place.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoo_hypothesis
They probably treat us like animals on National Geographic.
What if the people that were abducted by aliens were actually abducted by some alien TV host equivalent of the Crocodile Hunter, where he abducts a human and shows it off? "crikey what a interesting little fella this is?"
That's actually one of many theories about SETI and alien life. That they're so far ahead of us on the Kardashev scale that for them to try to communicate with us would be like us trying to communicate with ants. Or amoebas.
[deleted]
Those aliens probably watch us on TV while laughing at us: How can someone or something be that stupid.
I believe South Park tackled this thought in the episode "Canceled"
This is a very common and well known theory.  Its also called 'The Prime Directive' in the Star Trek universe.
Alien fanatics would be showing up once a week to tell us about space Jesus.
Maybe there’s an intergalactic agreement not to contact any life forms until they develop interstellar travel.
what if we're actually a part of a very huge being, and to that HUGE BEING, it's like when we look at our own cells through a microscope.  and that's just ONE BEING.  there could be millions of HUGE BEINGS.

We are probably more like the Sentinelese from the North Sentinel Island, part of the Andaman Island archipelago in Indian Ocean. They are widely considered as one of the most aggressive uncontacted tribe, very much hostile towards outsiders (though some would disagree).

The Indian government declared the remote island officially off limits.
What if those aliens are looking at this post and giggling like "they'll never know how right they are!"
We irradiated our own planet *on purpose*.  We're fucking nuts, man.
Everyone assumes that there are these superior entities that can conduct out of this world actions. 

But if you see the evolution of life on this earth, over 3 billion years of trial and error until a species with the capacity to be self aware about the universe starts to rise to dominance in the last 200,000 years. Only 10,000 since we’ve been having the amount of exponential progress we see today. 

For all we know, life out there could just be reptile-like creatures with no need to be highly intelligent to survive. Perhaps we’re the beginning of the alien species. If we ever colonize the universe, humans will evolve differently from one another in a series of rapid, radiative ways. Perhaps we’re the ancestors of all intelligent life in our local galaxy
More like "They're Made Out Of Meat"

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/They're_Made_Out_of_Meat
If that's true we probably killed some of them at one point. Most uncontacted tribes have also killed some of the past people who tried to contact them.
Theyre gonna be waiting a long time
That’s already a theory.

Edit: because I’m getting messages and comments about this, I wasn’t trying to belittle the guy or say this in a manner that implies I didn’t want him to post this here. I just thought that maybe he didn’t know this concept already existed as I’ve done this with other ideas and would like to know.
Depends. If there was an advanced society (or many) and they had a 'hands off' policy with Earth, likely the only way they'd actually be able to enforce it would be if their governing bodies had total control over their spaceflight operations. Which is conceivable, to a point, but as soon as you introduce the possibility of private ownership of spacecraft (manned or otherwise) and operations, it truly only takes that one dude looking for Space Reddit Karma to fuck it all up.
I like to think there’s the alien equivalent of David Attenborough who does the same thing to us as we do to other animals
Whelp, you have it at least half figured out. Truth is, we have been receiving all of those old video transmission, I am told they are called "Movies" wherein your people tend to dissect and kill all aliens that land on your planet. When we...er.. they start seeing you greet visitors with respect, maybe something interesting will happen.
What if we are first?
What if we’re more like an ant hill in the middle of the Amazon? 

Or even worse, like a bacterium on earth. There are 5x10^30 bacteria.
Most of those tribes remain uncontacted mostly because of concerns regarding introducing new diseases to them and because of the lack of the means for proper communication. I doubt these kind of issues would exist when it would come to aliens.
The Culture series covers this.
Then we probably will be contacted first by the extremist aliens who will give us the hard sell that their belief system is the best and that all we believe is a lie. And we will do something violent in response. Etc, etc. 

Eventually we all end up enslaved or die of an illness our immune systems cannot handle.
Iain M. Banks referred to this as the "Outside Context Problem."

You're an island civilization that's lived on that island alone for thousands of years, and your tiny achievements seem like monumental history. You've sent out canoes a few days' sailing to see if there are other islands, but they found nothing, so the priesthood concluded the island is The World and your 15,000 people are humankind.

Then a boat 10 times taller than your tallest building crests the horizon, people in shiny metal armor hop on to your shores, and suddenly everything means nothing.
I feel like they would tho, as we have tried so many attempts to reach out to them.
You really think the entire galaxy could all unanimously agree to something? To anything? Doubtful ...
Space is practically infinite, light is a hard limit, and even if you find ways to get out there at a comfortable speed, spacefaring cultures will spark, bloom, ebb, and die in the time you travel an infinitesimally small fraction of the distance from us (or our sci-fi lightspeed limit avoiding exit) to them and we'll/they'll never cross paths.

Read the Three Body Problem trilogy, then be glad they haven't contacted us yet.

TLDR: Anyone out there capable of understanding that we're here ought to be smart enough to know that we're also potentially dangerous to them, so they're better off killing us rather than contacting us. And, vice versa, except no we're humans so let's just tell everyone HEY GUYS HERE WE ARE.
There is the former leader of Israel’s space program who said that. He also said that the US and Israel have a base with aliens on mars and they said we are not aloud to know yet.
I think we're more like the folk out on the Sentinel Islands.  They know we're here, but every time someone tries to talk to us we take potshots at them.  So the whole planet is officially off limits.
One of the greatest flukes in evolution is when one cell ate another cell but didnt digest it. This allowed the one inside to focus entirely on creating energy allowing the main cell to focus on other things. This gave life the ability to to form multi cellular organisms inevitabily creating complex fauna. So it's also a belief that even if there are countless planets teaming with life right here in our own galaxy, none of them have 'advanced' to complex organisms.
They’d be smart not to contact us. We ruin everything we touch.

Edit: guess I need to clarify the two statements I made are opinion.
Unlikely since the galactic US-equivalent hasn't tried to invade us and give us "democracy" yet.
Well yeah this was already discovered don’t you remember? We were banned from the federation of planets because we tried to kill Babyfarts Mcgeezac and hid all of the stolen space cash from the space cops, so now we’re barred from any future alien contact
“Hah! Look at those idiots in the Milky Way.”(Eats child and shoots galactic space monsters with penis while making a drywall sandwich)
I hate mornings. I don't like waking up. I don't like breakfast as a genre or activity. I don't see a good reason to be anywhere ever before 10am.

I started forcing myself to wake up early and go to the gym before work. And i hate it so much but it makes me feel so goddam good all day long. It's a shitty healthy dose of morning endorphins that stops me from getting sleepy after lunch, keeps me energized after work, get a better night's sleep. 

It sucks so much and it sucks even more that it improves every aspect of my day because now if i stop i know i'll just start having shitty bad days again and it'll be my dumbass lazy fault with a simple fix.
That guy wants to settle for anything out of fear of nothing better coming later. That guy is okay with the dead-end job, the abusive relationships and no master's degree. I tell that guy it's never gotten me anywhere, it's the definition of "stuck" and I have no intention of being stuck anymore.
That guy's kicking my ass right now.
It used to be eat cheap pizza, chain smoke, and play video games. I changed a lot of those habits to healthier ones.
I used to have a little sign on my desk that said "The worst possible feeling is when the person you are meets the person you could have been."  It was there to encourage to pursue my goals rather than procrastinate on games, Reddit, etc.  I think it's time I dug that sign out again.
The guy who wants to go streaking during the Super Bowl halftime show. I avoid him by remembering that prison is not a pleasant place to be.
That guy’s cousin lives in my head, I go to AA meetings to avoid and outwit him.
Bold of you to assume I avoid him.
We came to an agreement and take turns occupying the same body. It's me from 5:30 am  to 5pm on weekdays. And he gets evenings,  weekends and holidays.
All that guy wants to do is do Reddit and play videogames.

I don't do anything to avoid him.
He just wants to win the lottery and sit on his couch watching dark comedies, drinking until it kills him.

I avoid this by remembering that my mother would be very sad if that happened, and that I want to love someone, like really be in love, at least one more time before I go.
I have the same exact same guy in my head. I quit smoking pot years ago, before i hit 30. I can still stay in bed all day on some days. What keeps me from doing it (having a 24h lay in on my laptop) too often are commitments I've made to myself, friends, and employers. Back in the day pot made it really easy to give up on those commitments. I miss pot, but I don't miss those times in general, which keeps me from going back.
I have chronic severe depression, going 25 years now. It's not completely clear what I have but it comes and goes (not SAD, not bipolar, not mdd, we simply don't know and medication doesn't work). However, it's never really gone, it's more like manageable or unmanageable.

The voice is either telling me I should lie down and just give up, or it's telling me that soon I will be lying down and giving up again. My manageable moments are obviously filled with as much joy as I can pack in there, and every night before going to bed I tell the voice to suck it, today was my day, not yours.

When it's unmanageable and the voice tells me to give up I try to fight him as long as I can, and when I start to agree with him I always manage to end it with "but not today".

It's kept me alive for this long, I hope I can keep going like this for awhile.
That guy is my ADHD. I probably have an extreme case where my meds, which are at high doses, hardly even work anymore. The best way I combat this urge to do something fun, play games, or goof off is to remove myself from any place of temptation. Cut it off before you get the thought of even doing something pleasurable.        

What I do is that I find empty classrooms at my college and study or do work in there. I will purposively drive away from my home (which is full of games, food, fun, and comfort) to a classroom just so I don’t get the urge, and even if I do, I’ve created a barrier that takes too much guilt and effort of driving back and doing something fun
Might get buried, but my dude in my head is literally Mr. Spock from Star Trek, and I don't avoid him.

Hear me out - I discovered through therapy that I needed a mechanism for judgement-less and objective self-analysis and Mr. Spock is that dude. He can see the most fucked up space shit ever and react calmly and objectively.


Mr. Spock: "The massive space blob has a 97.454% chance of consuming the ship and everyone inside within 4/7 minutes. Projections show it will be slow and painful."


Kirk: "That's horrible!"


Spock: "Yes, it is not ideal for our continued survival, but it's actions are entirely within the nature of the space blob."


So, whenever I get spun up on something in my head I imagine a mini-Spock in my head with a science terminal that can pull all data about ME. 


me: "Spock, science report."


Spock: "Data shows that godspeedmetal is 5.8 days from quitting smoking tobacco and is under great mental distress from the change of chemical intake. He isn't consciously aware of it, but he's attempting to make up an excuse to get gas on a half-tank in order to create an opportunity to buy a pack of cigarettes."


me: "Thank you, Spock, sounds like I'm being dishonest with myself. I suck!"


Spock: "I disagree. It's entirely within the nature of a nicotine addict to seek out a source of nicotine intake. This is neither Good or Bad. Just natural. Data also suggests that conscious awareness mitigates the chances of nicotine intake by 89.45%. You've yet to procure a nicotine source as well. Commendable."


Just going through that mental exercise will help knock me out of a mental spun-up state, help sort out emotions, feelings, all that stuff, into a parsed, objective, and most importantly, non-judgemental way.

EDIT: holy shit, I'm happy this was received as well as it was. This mechanism has helped myself so much, however I'd offer a couple of words of advice if you are intending to take on this method as well because it can be a frustrating mechanism to employ if you don't have your expectations set correctly. 

One - Spock's reports WILL be amended, appended, referenced and reworked entirely. This is all part of the process. Even Spock had several times where extended analysis was needed to understand something in order to create a way to cope/overcome/whathaveyou. Don't treat everything he says as immutable truth - his analysis is only as good as the data he is able to receive through that mental science terminal. Your initial reports will upgrade that terminal for stronger analysis in the future.

Two - You WILL fail, as well, and that's totally OK! He's analyzed far more for me than just smoking - everything from anxiety, struggles with work, and interpersonal relationships has been reviewed through that science terminal. But sticking with the smoking report as an example - recognizing that "getting gas" was just an excuse to get cigarettes didn't come from a single analysis, but was referenced from a prior "science report", as at one point I had quit smoking, went to get gas a few days later and drove away with a pack of cigs in my pocket. Spock reported, "godspeedmetal formulated a reason to create an environment that allowed his weakened will to procure a source of nicotine. Further analysis shows that nicotine addiction is extremely subversive to godspeedmetal's psyche at a subconscious level. The strength of control the addiction exerts upon his mind is quite strong. *Fascinating.*" Spock doesn't judge me - it all is what it is - and I respond, "That IS fascinating! My mind is stranger than I ever thought possible. However, I am more in control because I now recognize this pattern of behavior. I believe that this can be identified at a later point if I do this again. Thank you, Spock." That failure to stop smoking at that time was an opportunity to learn about myself. And FYI - I'm several months smoke free and still going!

Three - this isn't to make someone an emotionless logic machine, either - Spock understands human nature is an emotional experience. Humans get horny, sad, happy, angry, depressed, excited - all of that stuff that comprises the human condition - it's all part of the Logic of Being Human. Take that into account, yet strive to be aware of your humanity and make conscious decisions on what you do instead of sub-consciously reacting emotionally.

Four - trust your intuition. Your instincts have been developed over millions of years of evolution. Your mind is *powerful* and can sub-consciously recognize threats and boons to your world and yourself. Even if you don't understand *why* your guts are reacting they way they are, don't dismiss it. Run it by Spock and if you don't come to a satisfactory answer, you can always revisit later when you've more experience, time, and data.
The guy in my head wants to lay in my pillow-top bed with soft, soft sheets, my buffy blanket, memory foam pillows, and sleep 18 hours a day (and hide from everyone).  

Punctuated by gorging myself on (good) takeout food, getting raving drunk, and just watch endless history documentaries and plan travel trips for next year. If that's all I did I would also probably take up smoking pot again, too.
I accept that she exists, and love her back to health
I relate to this. The girl in my head is constantly trying to get out of doing things - every "thing" like going to work, going to school, socializing, etc. Anything besides sitting at home in my chair, smoking a joint, and watching some coming-of-age drama/comedy. I have to force myself everyday to do all the stuff that being an adult human requires of me. It's hard. I think almost everyone feels this way.
That girl is depression. She's definitely starting to kick my ass now. All she wants to do is lay in bed, self-harm, and cry. 

I take my medications and persevere, but it's difficult.
I let her out and feed her once in a while, that way she lets me get on with my life!

EDIT:Added link
The guy in my head not letting me lay in bed all day smoking pot and watching cartoons..
*closes pornhub* 

I dunno what you're talkin' bout.
That guy wants to die. Unsure how to avoid him. Copious amounts of caffeine seems to do okay.
That guy for me is someone who is constantly grumpy, never wants to get out of pajamas, and loves being drunk and high. 

To avoid said guy, I make a conscious effort to stay productive, motivate myself, and never drink alone.
I figure that I may as well share about my guy. 

My guy hates me, and what little bit of a life I've built for myself. The guy in me just wants to lay in bed all day, every single day, until I age out and die. Don't even get me started on the *other thing* the guy wants to do to me... And, yeah, it's pretty similar to Bourdain's in terms of its other cravings. 

To fight back, I try listening to music that fits my emotions at the moment. I try keeping my hands busy, and luckily I enjoy cooking. Deck building for magic the gathering can also help. I try to be creative and draw more. I try to exercise. I go out and tell jokes at open mics. I try to do everything that my guy doesn't want me to do. I want to be better than the guy that my guy wants me to be. He does have a grip on me most days, but I try my hardest to get out of it.
Holy shit Anthony said that? Damn. I miss him even more.
I just wanna grill for gods sake
He’s the voice that tells me to stop what I’m doing and end it all. To avoid him I just ignore what he says. At the moment he’s wrong.
Have to say, I am touched by OP’s attentiveness to responses displaying distress. Wholesome.
Ah, RuPaul caller her the “inner saboteur”. It sounds cliché but it’s so true.     
And “that guy” never really goes away, you just have to learn to stay one step ahead.
Why try to outwit and avoid that guy?  My goal in life is to find a way to sustain the lifestyle that guy suggests.  The only reason I even do any of that other "ambitious" stuff is so that I can do all the nothing I want.

Bill Watterson wasn't exactly saying what Bourdain's head guy was, but he had a good [middle ground philosophy](https://zenpencils.com/comic/128-bill-watterson-a-cartoonists-advice/) between complete slacker and crazy Steve Jobs as a CEO mentality.
That guy is me.
Tried doing push-ups.... gave all the motivation I needed to get off my ass cause I was so pathetic
The one that wants to to something drastic to qualify for Social Security disability and then, jobless, lounge around all day drinking beer, watching whatever, and roaming around GTA 5 as I eat the gubment cheese.
[deleted]
My guy wants to smoke weed and play guitar all day.  It just happens to be my job and I'm trying to turn it into an originals career now with a new band. I got tired of fighting him so I just embraced the fucker.
I’m a microbiology major, premed and all but sometimes I really just want to stay at home and be a cute little housewife. I want to have three kids and be a pta mom! I love the idea but I know I couldn’t be truly happy with that.
My guy just wants to sleep. All fucking day.
oh  i am suppose to AVOID him? oof
The guy doesn't believe I'll ever be happy. He thinks I'll ruin every relationship I'm in and give up on every endeavor I do. My hobbies and family help me out.
Mine tells me to end it and that even all the hurt that comes with it that it's better to leave everyone and everything and start over. He just wants to start over. 

Started selling all my stuff to appease him.
Me right now.
I finally admitted this week I am depressed.
Now I have to do something about.
Poor Anthony Bourdain. Rest In Peace
[deleted]
My guy doesn't want to bother being alive. I avoid him by positive thinking, recognizing mental distortions, therapy, and increasingly exercise.
I don’t avoid him. I hate all this climb the ladder, work constantly, ‘self-improvement’ shit. It’s just about making you feel bad about yourself in the hopes you will buy some shit you don’t need. As far as I can tell all it does is make people desperately unhappy. They become perfectionists and they are never good enough for themselves. 

I work hard, I live a quiet life, and you can bet your arse I will spend my free time relaxing and engaging in personally enjoyable activities. 

I don’t owe this world my ‘best self’, because I’m fine as I am. I certainly don’t need to buy any ‘motivational material’ or other cliched shite to make myself feel better. I don’t need a program, I don’t need to pay a man to show me how to do incredibly basic gym moves, and I don’t need any fucking entrepreneurial seminars.

Basically fuck off and let me spend my goddamn Sunday’s getting high and enjoying what little time I have on this Earth.
That guy for me is the same as his. Fukk
Sonofabitch gets nothing.  All he wants to do is drink his life away.  Hes already had 10 years of my life, he doesnt get a second more!
Same guy. He wins most days but I’m trying.
So the guy (gal) in my head is kind of a depression riddled monster. She tells me I'm worthless, useless, will never amount to anything. I go to therapy once a week to learn ways to outsmart her and prove her wrong. I don't think it will ever stop but I'm learning ways to cope.
[Uh...](https://media.giphy.com/media/l3fZFvp94ljepXoPe/giphy.gif)
Same thing as tony described.
I used to tak lots of Adderall to chain that mofo down. 
He's what I call the devil but really he's just depression and anxiety due to BS like existentialism. 

Anyways. Treat yourself well, even the demons. They're part of you too. True healing doesn't come from pills. I found that out the hard way.
Ive been recently dealing with a pretty tough breakup, one that i caused due to me not being mentally well. I decided to start going to Therapy once a week and Ive been pushing myself out of bed every single morning to go for a 30 min run before work and after work i hit them gym. Im just trying to be a better person for myself and actually be happy with my life for once. I know things dont come over night but with progress ill reach my goal eventually.
If I have the will, multiple strategies work including, eating properly, exercising, meditation, talking to friends, talking to family, keeping clear priorities of what I want to do.... unfortunately every now and then something trips everything up and the will to out maneuver the 'guy in my head' isn't there. That guy is all the more persuasive when you feel like a (to quote Kyle Kinane) “stripped-bare toothless cog spinning freely and ineffectually in the working machine of society”.
I joined the Army.

Now that guy doesn't have much of a choice.
That girl does a lot of partying and is a free bird flying but this woman's kids keep her grounded and at home.
I dunno... that guy sounds ok to me. I'd hang out with him. Cartoons are awesome.
The guy in my head just wants to eat junk food, play videogames and jerkoff all day long. I only avoid him by going to work but on my days off it's a party.
For me that girl wants to be a stay at home mom who sells MLM and drinks a PSL with her jogging buddies but I work, cook amazing meals and hunt becuase I know I wouldnt truly be happy if I gave up the empowerment of making my own money and truly enjoying the things i want.
I am that guy a lot of the time. I used to be super productive and stress out overwork. I think Bourdain may still be alive if he would have spent more time doing nothing instead of  trying to catch the next thing all the time with strangers.
I don't man, he's not so bad. We're having a pretty good time together right now.
“That guy” is a little kid who wants to play outside, eat delicious treats, and hide far, far away from people. That kid still thinks if we get in trouble (and there’s no telling if or why we are), someone will come and take away all the nice things in our life.

My life is a haphazardly-sketched idea to avoid staying that kid, and becoming a well-rounded, adequately socialized adult. Someday I might even take a risk, who knows.
That other guy is an out of control alcoholic, one step away from total Oblivion. I fight with my other self a lot and we've come to a sort of agreement. Booze twice a week and no black outs. Otherwise, I lock things down and that shitty drunk doesn't get any booze at all. It seems to be working ok.

ETA, it's taken me many years to tame the beast in my mind. And sometimes the beast still wins and I go on a bender. But for the past year or so, I've been able to mostly moderate and my life and my health has gotten so much better.

Wasn't this exact question asked very recently?
Isn't the whole point of Reddit to create your own personal echo chamber by curating which subs are in your feed?
“Well like as Miss Universe that would like totally make me appreciate like the internet and stuff. I would just hope all the countries in the USA like Alabama and New York and like California to unite as one across the globe”
How do you feel about *insert agreeable feature*
Can Americans get access to the filter too?
I feel like I’ve seen this just on another sub
It already exists, friend. It's called Reddit Enhancement Suite and you can set up as many keyword filters as your heart desires. Those filters can be subreddit specific or global in nature. Not only that, you can ignore certain users and you can block posts from a given domain. I can't imagine using Reddit without it.
What I'd really like is a "Karma Whore" filter to get rid of all these groupthink posts so I can see some real content.
[deleted]
this is such a stupid ask reddit.
I wish there was a fucking repost filter. Fuck u reddit.
mom* says I get to post this tomorrow

edit: fuck
People of Reddit, how would you feel if there was “My opinion but as if it’s a question” filter where users seeking interesting discussions can scroll through r/AskReddit without seeing dull shit like this?
Gotta love low effort posts
Is it that time of the day again?
Depends on what subs you've joined. When i scroll through my feed it's mostly Dutch related news because that is where i live.

EDIT: After reading most of the comments i realised that the OP is absolutely right. Many people are complaining about US related news in their own country subs. That US ralated content filter has to become a thing indeed. Something like a checkbox when you create a post in a non-American sub. Americanism has become a virus lately. America is not the world. The world is the world.

Though it's also the behaviour of many non-Americans that have been sucked up by all the American news around them. So much that they are now living in it. It reminds me of a friend of mine. With him it's only about "Trump did this and Trump did that". But also things like "in America this and in America that". It goes on forever. Are you also like that? Well then... PLEASE STOP! So we can make the rest of the world great again.
Cool, as long as this applies to the comments too. Europeans love to bring the US into every non-related discussion too.  

You could have a video of a dog licking someone's face, then someone would reply "that happened to me once but I got sick from it" and then someone will reply "good thing you weren't in America or you would've been put into bankruptcy LOLOLOL".  And then and endless thread circlejerking about American healthcare.
It would be useless since theres already a country selector at the top when you're not on the home page and theres plenty of news subs that ban American-only news.
People of Reddit, how would you feel if there was a filter to sort out these stupid "People of Reddit, how would you feel if there was (insert agreeable feature)" posts?
I don't see why not. We should be able to filter out whatever we want. I'm an American living abroad so I like getting news from reddit but I totally understand why people don't want to be inundated with US news all the time.
only if i can get a no-euro-bullshit filter
This exact question was posted about a few weeks back.
I dunno. I come here at least partly to find out about what's going on in the world. America is part of the world - for better or worse, an important part.

On the other hand, I would rather not hear about how everything that happens in any other country surely relates back to something happening in America in every thread.
People of reddit, can I karma whore?
/s
Americans make up 49% of the traffic on Reddit, the next highest is Canada with 7%.

I’m shocked most of the content is American based!!!!
I would love nothing more than to not have to scroll through Europeans commenting on America
As an european one of the many reasons I like reddit is that is often US focused, so I get exposed to news/views/opinions/ideas I otherwise wouldn't.

Also it's interesting to compare how you guys are living some events and how media here report it.
How would this magic filter even work? It would be useless. You'd either have to ask every poster on every sub to tag something if it was US-related (so, hardly anyone would ever do it) or you'd have to have them tagged manually (waste of everyone's time *and* would still miss most posts due to the sheer number of posts being made every second on reddit.) Or you could do it the worst possible way and have a bot do it, maybe if you're lucky a well-trained bot might get it right more than half the time.

The filter would never work. Most posts would not be properly marked, and even if they were you'd still find mountains of US-specific posts in comments of any post ever. Unless you think every comment would also be somehow tagged as US related, in which case: yes sir I'd also like the winning lottery numbers now since you are apparently magic.
I dunno man. I'm kinda enjoying the whole shit show, in a not my circus not my animals kinda way.
Why not just control what subs you subscribe to? Stop with the major ones, get more local and hobby-focused, and the problem should take care of itself.
It'd be great.  Then the people who have never been to the USA that regularly dispense their post-adolescent, early-undergraduate advice based on 30-second Insta videos and memes can fuck right off.  But they won't of course, because they are fascinated with doing so.  They'll ignore the filter and keep right on doing it, secure in their superiority.
Yeah so all of you can stop bitching constantly.
Lol they wouldn't use it. For all the complaining, people who aren't from or don't live in in the U.S, sure love to talk about everything going on here.
Does it work the other way, too?  Can we prevent foreigners from interfering in domestic political discussions? 

If so, I'm all in favor!
I mean as long as you can do it for every country I don't see any issues with it.
Ok Its my turn to post this next week.
Wasn’t this asked/posted on another sub a few days ago?
Yes, this was popular every other time it was suggested, which is pretty much when anything significant occurs in the US, which has been nearly constant over the last 4 years.

If ONLY Reddit wasn't an American site and other countries had their own internet cultures to fall back on. If you don't want US news, consider supporting a website hosted and run in your own country.
Maybe it's time that a different company and application is made. Stop using an American app and complaining that there's too many American things on it.
I would love this! And as an American I would love to be able to turn on that filter
Given that there's a madman in charge of the country with the capability to turn the world into a nuked cinder, who just tried to mount a coup, the only thing I am interested in seeing on Reddit is effing America. At least till 20th Jan, I really don't care about r/tifu talking about fingering... so there...
can americans get in on this? i dont want to hear about this shit either...
I’m here for picture of puppies and kittens. If I wanted the news I would watch the news.
this is a repost, i saw this question a while back
How would you feel about filtering out 'How would you feel if there was \[agreeable feature\] posts?
I'd be fine with it as long as I could filter out people bitching about what other folks are posting.  Like this post.
I'm not opposed to it or anything but I find it weird that people come onto an American website and then complain about seeing majority American content
Can people from the USA use it too??? Asking for a friend...
I live in America and I would love this
Bro, I got a new phone and was trying to login on my old account. I was so confused when nothing worked. I was tired of this and went on Reddit to see this. At least I know the reason.
Well I work for T-mobile as tech support so my entire day has basically been ''yeah that's not us and it's not your fault'', but seeing a little more activity on reddit is nice. lol
With the influx of visitors it's only a matter of time before Reddit servers also go down
MySpace is working fine   :)   Just sayin'
I was wondering why i kept seeing the same 5 posts on facebook lmfao
Didn’t know they were down but that explains why my friend stopped replying all of a sudden… I hope
For a change it’s not reddit thats down
Didn't know they were down but that explains why I haven't heard from my sister yet today. 

Thanks, dude.
As long as i have something to scroll endlessly with ads and strong opinions I feel alive.
I thought my internet was the problem. Turns out the universe is just sending me a sign to stop mindlessly scrolling through someone else's timeline.
Oh, I kept trying to refresh my feed on Insta and it wouldn't work.   


Welp, it's pretty nice here.
I thought my wifi was stupid
I already exhausted all of my usual subs hours before this happened. The internet is dead to me.

EDIT: Hey mom, you said I'd never amount to anything. Well, look at me now.
Interesting that it happens the very next day after the "60 Minutes" interview with Facebook whistleblower.

Article:  Facebook’s very, very bad day: Services go down as stock plunges in wake of whistleblower revelations.

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebooks-very-very-bad-day-services-go-down-as-stock-plunges-in-wake-of-whistleblower-revelations-11633365581?siteid=yhoof2](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebooks-very-very-bad-day-services-go-down-as-stock-plunges-in-wake-of-whistleblower-revelations-11633365581?siteid=yhoof2)
I've been trying to send something funny from reddit via WhatsApp. This is not good I'm trying to flirt!
I was wondering why my wife was talking to me more
I did go to Facebook first. Now im here. And now im not.
i mean the only difference is i was gonna probably dm someone
I paid my bill thinking it was late LOL
Wonder if it has anything to do with the 60 mins whistleblower thing
The only thing I use Facebook for is giving stuff away. So does anyone want a high chair?
Suddenly my clients are back to email again and I love it!!!
Sorry guys. It's my birthday today, and all the many friends I have posted too many birthday wishes. Crashed the Facebooks.
The average reddit user hates everything, and hopes Facebook never comes back.
I like Reddit, and i'm browsing through it like crazy, but i hope that atleast WhatsApp is going to work again in the next lets say 30 minutes.
So I noticed this was all over the news this morning: https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-ahead-senate-hearing-2021-10-03/

Now FB is down. Hmmmm….
What did anonymous finally get around to hacking Facebook?
What if, this is it?   
The moment Facebook ended.
THE GREAT WIFI RESET HAPPENED TODAY
Reddit dies way too often to flex though
Probably most of reddit: "wait, they're down?"
I laughed a little when I realized that this is a world wide thing. What the guck went wrong?😂
Facebook deleted my account a couple months ago without a chance to appeal. For all I care, they can stay down for good.
This shows why monopolies are a problem. If Zuckerberg didn’t own everything, only Facebook would be down.
I thought the 4G tower finally turned the frogs gay
I'm fascinated by what is happening.  Close off channels of international communications.  Spread messages of widespread shortages everywhere to activate the hoarders.  Whistleblower's testimony causes market instability.  Now a date breach dump exposing wealthy people using tax havens.
I dumped FaceBook/Insta last year when I realized it added absolutely zero value to anything.
Less misinformation will be spread today.
It's down everywhere i guess across the world.
Honestly? Completely ruined my Reddit experience since I use FB Messenger to share Reddit links with my other half. 

I had to *text* her. Like some sort of caveman! 

Next the texts will stop working and I’ll have to *get out of my chair and walk across the room* to show her a Reddit post!
Well, rip me. I originally tried to respond to every comment but that’s not gonna happen. Inbox exploding! This is a fantastic way to celebrate my cake day and a nice greeting after my therapy session, thanks yall!
I can't crop screenshots of memes to people anymore.  And, uh, that's it for now.
Not affected, but I did switch reddit to the top - last hour setting to see if reddit is posting about it, just to find every other post is from r/Superstonk after which I found this post.
I’m just here to figure out when FB is working again - signed suburban middle aged mom
A reporter was liveblogging something via IG stories, so now she's just using Twitter instead.
It turned me into a newt!
I am always on all 3 while I work from home. The biggest difference now is I am texting people instead of using messenger.
Honestly, it’s making me realize how often I reflexively check Facebook. That place is a cesspit. I feel better knowing I can’t access it
I’m stuck doing actual work at work instead of browsing Instagram. This is stupid.
My guess is that Facebook took down their servers on purpose to show us all how much we depend on them, and tomorrow they'll be like "If you don't make us rulers of Earth right now we'll take our servers down for good". Those nefarious bastards...
Guessing Fuckerbot's motherboard is shorting over the falling stock prices.
What are the chances this has to do with Pandora papers? 🤔
I have to regularly text my sister rather than use WhatsApp, which is annoying. But Reddit is usually more interesting than Facebook/Instagram anyway so that doesn’t change much.
Not a problem since I don't use any of those anymore. Reddit is my go to place
I Can't be the only one who thought my WiFi was just ass
All I did was try to make my status about epipens incase someone wasn't familiar with it. And it went down 😅 so here's a refresh or something new to learn 

Just incase this could help someone: Blue to the sky, Orange in the thigh.
When using an EpiPen, pull the blue cap straight up, removing the cap. Swing and push the orange tip into the middle of the thigh. Count, one one thousand, ect up to 3. Remove. You'll never see the needle, and it can be administered through clothing if necassary.🙃
I didn't even notice they're down, lol. I'm spending my time reading posts here, playing on my Wii and watching (more like listening to) YouTube. It's blissful and I love it.
What if this was it? The moment. The point in time. The day Facebook goes down and never comes back.
This is why people at work keep telling me the internet is down because it most certainly is working fine. They are all trying to do social media.....schmucks
Lol didn’t even notice the other sites are down before this question
Didn't even notice
Wifi on campus has been awful this past week, so I assumed it was just that again, but I suppose I’m not alone for once. 

Currently studying for two exams I’ve got this week. Feeling really good about it. Hopefully two easy A’s but we’ll see. One is a practical lab on a dissection of a shark and a cat. Need to know the muscles and skeletal structure

Hope everyone is having a good day. Times are whack and stressful, but you guys are great, so keep doing what you’re doing :)
By going to r/terriblefacebookmemes, you can get the full Facebook experience even when it is down.
But yea I don’t use Facebook so…
You just named 3 things I live happily without.

However if Reddit went down I'd probably go punch the Sun.
I guess I'll just post my Facebook update here since it is down....

"I've learned that one of the side effects to my covid vaccination is that I can gather in pretty safe groups with my vaccinated family. It feels weird!"
Reddit, if anything, seems *faster*
Just like that, influencers got fired.
Finally DM’d my crush on IG last night, we texted briefly, sent something smooth this morning and was waiting anxiously for a response… then IG wasn’t working but everything else was, I thought I was going crazy. Thank god it’s down for everyone I was about to have a panic attack lmao
Santibodies.
We will see ads with Santa wearing a facemask.
Santa is magic. That being said the poor elves took a huge hit from the pandemic so there are less toys to go around this year. Strictly one per child or 2 between 3
He'll send the elves as they are expendable.
He invented "contactless delivery"
Clearly Santa Claus is immune to all disease and does not spread or carry disease from house to house.
hazmat santa
I think it would be a great excuse to get them to go to bed. Tell them he won't come unless he knows everyone is shut away in their rooms so he won't accidentally come within 2m of someone.
The dude has flying reindeer and can bend time and space to ensure he visits everyone over the course of a single night.

COVID-19 ain't got shit on Santa.
I'm sorry, but Santa didn't survive the pandemic little one.
Santa contracted the virus and is self-isolating in the North Pole.
Santa knows how to use a mask, and Lysols everything so it will be ready to open in the morning... now, go to bed so he can properly social distance from you little sh\°ts.
Santa took 3 levels in paladin
I'm waiting for Jacinda Ardens stance, she was pretty spot on with the Easter bunny and Tooth fairy

https://youtu.be/nHOa4TtkOeU
Leave a bottle of hand gel alongside the mince pie, carrot and sherry.
He's magic, that shit don't fuck with magic!
Most likely he's simply using his orbital present launcher to shoot everyone's gifts across the gulf of space into the appropriate spots in their homes.
With no thought of the pandemic, I was talking to my family yesterday about their plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It wasn't until they said "well let's see how the cases look by then" that I got pulled back into reality that the holidays, the best time of the year for most people, is going to be very lonely and possibly depressing.
*stares in Jewish*
Santa's considered an essential worker.
Parents: this is the moment you've been waiting for.  You can remove Santa from the picture guilt free.  "Santa unfortunately died of COVID along his route and fell into his watery grave in the Atlantic ocean."
THE ELF ON THE SHELF CAN FINALLY DIE

He’s magic, he has flying rain deer and fly through the night and do they believe in Santa they’ll believe anything you say about him
The same way you explain away all the other reasons not to go into other people's houses
He's not real, I'm/we're the ones buying the presents. Now please ask for cheaper stuff


No need to thank me
Doesn't he touch his nose a lot too? Don't touch your face!
If wears a mask.

Other than that I expect that the same magic that allows him to visit everyone in such a short time also protects him and prevents him from spreading diseases.

If kids ask he has experience with regular flue and past disease outbreaks, he is quite good at it now.

All kidding aside, I hope this years x-mas decorations show Santa wearing a mask.
Is the truth an option here?
Santa's Beard is Anti-Microbial, Vaccine is being developed from his beard extract
If I have kids, I’m not gonna tell them the lie of Santa

Edit: Why would I do such a horrendous thing, right? Well, I’m a fairly religious guy, so if I lie to my kids about Santa, what’s to say I’m not lying about Jesus? (I am prepared for downvotes now)
Well he will still be able to social distance right.
His elves make the best PPE. It’s rona proof, but it only works with that special Christmas magic.
Tell them he doesn't exist. Pull the bandaid.
Easy: STOP LYING TO YOUR KIDS!!!!
Sounds like a good time to tell your kids the truth about Santa.
If the kid believes in Santa then they're  already gullible enough to believe any excuse you throw at them.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/screenrant.com/santa-claus-marvel-comics-omega-level-mutant/amp/

He’s the most powerful mutant in the universe. Got my story ready!
So many easy answers:

1) Santa practices social distancing. I mean, except for kissing the occasional mommy, he usually works alone. 
2) Santa is magic; diseases don’t affect him. 
3) Santa caught it in April and is all better now. There are excellent doctors in the North Pole. 
4) Santa got the vaccination so he wouldn’t make anyone sick when he visits. 
5) Rudolph’s nose emits ultraviolet light, so Santa gets sanitized each time he gets back in the sleigh. 


Crazy answers for “fun” parents:

6) Santa is already dead. He’s been a friendly zombie for centuries.

7) Santa signed a contract with Amazon to deliver all his presents this year.

8) Santa is a saint, so he can perform miracles. Miracle makers can’t stay sick. 

9) Santa is a robot and robots don’t catch diseases. 



Answer for mean, realistic, or boring parents:

10) Santa’s not real, so he doesn’t get sick.
This is as good a time as any to tell you we’ve been lying to you about this whole Santa thing. The world is a dumpster fire and there’s no way in hell any respectable adult would let a strange man into their house to shower their children with presents.
Santa maintains at least 6 feet away from people.  And what looks like a beard, this year is actually a mask.
He drops the presents into the fireplace (or by windows so if no fireplace, open window after puting presents next to tree) so he won't come in contact with everyone and he's sorry for that (but he insists on the fact that it's important everyone does like him if they don't want virus). Also he's wearing a mask this year and has special snow gloves. And his elves are giving him that very rare medecine (chloroquine if you wanna tell them) so it's less probable that he brings the virus with the presents
In accordance with worldwide pandemic guidelines, Santa is now using Amazon to deliver presents.
If COVID is still running wild in December I think it is time for you to have some more serious discussions with your kids. Santa is the least of your worries.
I mean, if you've already committed to this lie, "he's magic, duh" will suffice.
The best solution is to stop lying to your kids.
A masked man coming into your house in the middle of the night to leave you a present from the end of your bed is something I feel like I’ve seen a video of online somewhere...
I'm honestly tempted to just say we use this to end his reign, then lead into the decommercialization of the holiday and turn it back into a time of true merriment and go back to celebrating it in a way more similar to the olden days with merry parties for young and old alike, feasting around the table, and just a time to put your work down, gather with the people you love, and simply enjoy yourself in whatever way you please.

But since we can't have nice things, he has a magic mask that completely protects his entire body from every last particle of the virus that the elves made him.
Santa? It’s 2020. Krampus will be coming to town this year.

https://www.freecycle.org its litterly people giving away stuff they dont need/want any more that they can't/don't care enough to sell
1aauto.com

It is a car parts supplier, but their videos show exactly what tools you need, what parts you need, and how to do a repair yourself. Great money saver if you don’t know much about mechanics. Someone I knew was going to get screwed by their mechanic (700 bucks for a water pump replacement). Showed them that, they did it themselves for 30 bucks. It makes it quicker too, knowing what tools you need ahead of time for your particular car.

Edit: I agree they’re not the best for parts, this was just about their videos. For parts, rockauto.com is great. If you need an item quicker and have an Advanced Auto nearby, order online and pick up in store. They almost ALWAYS have a coupon online for at least 20% off, which you can apply and pick up in store, around 30 minutes later, yet save quite a bit versus just going in and buying.

Last edit: For those that are not mechanically inclined and do not want to mess with it, use Repairpal.com when you receive a quote and make sure the price is reasonable. It will give you a pretty general idea of what you should be paying in your area. It’s not 100%, but will help keep you from getting ripped off. Unfortunately, there are a lot of shops that will take advantage of a situation. Not saying all, of course, but that way you will know for sure. Thanks for the silver, as well!

Takes some skill to learn how to use but they have tutorials on the site.
[skiplagged.com](https://www.skiplagged.com) for flights. It’s so good that United sued them and [lost](https://money.cnn.com/2015/05/01/investing/united-airlines-lawsuit-skiplagged/index.html).

They essentially exploit the pricing manipulation that airlines use. Example, if you want to go from Phoenix to Atlanta, sometimes a ticket from Phoenix to Ft. Lauderdale connecting through Atlanta is cheaper. This website finds those flights for ya. Just don’t check in a bag!

Edit: A succinct [article](https://www.godsavethepoints.com/skiplagged-travel-trick-story/) highlighting tips and risks. Summary: use it sparingly and you'll be good.

Edit 2: The website's creator did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2o831k/i_run_skiplagged_a_site_being_sued_by_united/) 5 years ago.
https://archive.org/ has lots of old but free content. For example a lot of DOS games, directly playable through the browser.

[My 90s TV](http://www.my90stv.com/)

This is more of a novelty website, but I think it's pretty cool and you can lose yourself for hours with nostalgia. It basically uses YouTube videos to simulate watching TV in 90s and you can specify what year you want and what categories you want to see when you change channels.

There is also a [My 80s TV](http://www.my80stv.com/) and a [My 70s TV](http://www.my70stv.com/)
Wikipedias reading lists. The article itself often holds a pretty good collection of relevant information, yet for in depth research it can be hard to find proper literature. Wikipedia always quotes their sources which often are the most relevant for a topic. Unless you aren't researching for your Phd. you can save a lot of time in literature research.
Astronomer here! You can look up all the satellites flying over your house tonight, including the ISS, Hubble Space Telescope, those pesky Starlink satellites, and whatever else your heart desires, complete with star maps and precise timing. The website is called [Heavens Above](https://www.heavens-above.com) and there is an Android app, but unfortunately no iOS one last I checked. (For iOS I use “Sputnik!” which is free and tells me the ISS and Hubble passes overhead.)

It should be noted btw that many if not most of these objects are visible even in a city if on a good pass right above you. So out and see some cool stuff! :)
I recently found this from another subreddit 

https://melody.ml/

Use it.
I swear.

U can isolate vocals, drums, bass from mp3. Files
You'll need an email address to download the isolated files

Instead of using my own email I just used a 10 min mail and downloaded it that way.

Today I isolated the vocals from a song and it's surprisingly in good quality!

BUT u only can use it from desktop, it's not meant for mobile use.

Enjoy

Thank you for the Plat, Gold and Silver. I have my very own Christmas Tree :D
Last time this was posted, I learned about Letterboxing (fun, free, outdoor activity - AtlasQuest.com), Libby (Free library audiobooks and ebooks - get it in the app store) and free meditation retreats (dhamma.org).  I'm definitely saving this post.  

Edited to include links.
 I'm going to save this like I have the other 100 useful Reddit questions I didn't know I wanted to be answered, and never look at it again.
Reddit coins right now, just upvote shit and you may get some
[Top Class Actions](https://topclassactions.com/category/lawsuit-settlements/open-lawsuit-settlements/) basically a site that lists active class action lawsuits you might qualify for. I've used it for trivial things like suing red bull for a free case because it "didn't give me wings" but on a serious note. It made me aware of the suit against Equifax for leaking my data. That should be a settlement worth over a $100. It's a cool way to hold corporations semi accountable, and score some money/freebies for any wrongdoing that went under the radar.

TL;DR: it's literally free *legal* money
Your local library almost certainly allows you to access free ebooks and audiobooks via Overdrive (and the Libby app), Hoopla, or BorrowBox. All you need is a library card and a PIN, which you'll probably need to get in-branch -- but really, is there ever a *bad* excuse to go to a library?

The selection might be limited, but if you want to splash out a little, you can get a year's out-of-state access to Brooklyn Public Library for $50. That's not as good as free, but it can be a lot cheaper than using Audible, especially if you get through audiobooks at a real rate.
YouTube lessons on how to do anything your heart desires.
MOOCs.

There are thousands upon thousands of college courses available for free.  Some have a cost, but most of them have a free audit version where you get all the videos, lectures, content, but no certificate.  So if you don't care about the certificate, you don't have to pay anything.

I've done a few computer science ones.  I took a few Coursea courses on machine learning, I took Harvard's CS50 course, I learned a lot of software engineering and web development from free courses.  Another one I intend to take advantage of is called Nand to Tetris, which teaches how computers work from primitive boolean algebra to actual functional operating systems.

Look them up.
Codecademy is an awesome site to learn how to use some programming languages. Doesn't get into the really advanced stuff, but it's good for a start.
Google Maps and Waze are so useful if still blows my mind that they are free. Waze does have ads that show up when you are stopped but it's still free and had a lot of great features. They have slowly been moving the more popular features to Google Maps too like speed trap reports and current speed/speed limit.
[photopea](http://photopea.com)

It's a Photoshop clone that is completely free (unintrusive side banner ad, can be removed by a one time payment) and has all the basic features of Photoshop, using basically the same interface. If you're used to Photoshop and just need to get something quick done, there's nothing better out there.

Best of all, it's completely contained within your browser. There's no installation, no local files, not even an account or sign in.

Music. We take it for granted in this youtube era but just a few decades ago, music wasn't accessible to people at all and not even the rich had access to all types of it. Now this globalized era has given us countless options
Use Khan Academy for literally everything. It’s free knowledge that you can use to clep out of university courses, or to simply invest your time in a worthwhile topic. Free *quality* education is best education.

Edit:
Holy crap I go to take a nap and this post has both the most upvotes I’ve ever gotten, and my first Reddit silver. Two of them too!! Y’all are [awesome](http://kevinclarkcomposer.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/whos_awesome.jpg) . I think I’ll start reading through the responses now. (And now platinum? Holy moley. I’m at a loss for words. Thank you!!)

Edit edit: Oh my god y’all have some great ideas. It’s incredible how such a small comment can spark such interesting conversations.
If you're an avid reader like me, then https://www.freebooksy.com/ is a godsend. Lots of ebooks that a free for a limited time period and you can sign up for newsletters in the genres you prefer.
If you’re at all interested in learning 3D modeling or animation, check out Blender. The program is entirely free and just received its latest update to 2.8 which makes it super accessible to new people. A search on YouTube would also lead you to find tons of free tutorials to try and maybe build a hobby on. There are also loads of free add ons and lots of other content from other Blender users. The Blender stack exchange is REALLY active too, so if you get stuck on trying to make something, feel free to ask and you would usually receive an answer in very little time.

A few financial ones, please note: i am NOT affiliated with these in any way, I just use them and really think they are great tools for managing online shopping, budgets, and life. They all have free apps as well.

&#x200B;

[privacy.com](https://privacy.com) is AWESOME, I absolutely love their service. It allows you to credit credit cards on the fly that are site specific, set a spending limit on them, make them one time only, etc. So you can literally create a separate credit card for every single site you shop on, and be very comfortable in knowing that if they get hacked, your card isn't compromised. Its also super handy for "free trial but must enter CC" type things.

&#x200B;

[Mint.com](https://Mint.com) \- Great budgeting site from turbotax (So if you have problems with them, don't use it) - it allows you to create a budget, then automatically categorizes transactions from linked accounts to show you how you are doing with regards to your budget. Its easy to setup and adjust, and really helps to monitor where your spending is going

&#x200B;

[Lastpass.com](https://Lastpass.com) \- Everyone should be using unique passwords for everything, which means you need to remember them, which is impossible. [lastpass.com](https://lastpass.com) is a great tool that manages them for you.
New computer? [ninite.com](https://ninite.com) can get you all the software you use and then some in one quick, easy to use installer.

Duolingo
I have been using this for quick Spanish lessons with my morning coffee for a couple years now. It doesn't override the need to take classes for college credits, but I recently had to take a course and it was a breeze. There are a few hundred languages that it teaches and the mobile app makes it easy to do anywhere while waiting.
Let me tell you about an app called Reddit, I've learned many things from this app, best part it's free and ads can be skipped and you can get help for almost anything
So many books are available online for free. Maybe not all are entirely legal, but if you're a fellow morally bankrupt person, then read away.

[Freerice.com](https://freerice.com/game)

It's a pretty simple educational game setup, the difficulty increases as you get longer streaks of correct answers, and every correct answer translates to 10 grains of rice (or the rough cost equivalent) through ads which display throughout playing the game.

Playing serves to shows user activity on the site which is what they use to determine cost to advertisers and thus the use of the site actually generates the funds to buy the food (not like they are sitting on a scrooge mcduck vault of rice and parceling it out 10 grains at a time.)  And it's not just rice, they use the funds to purchase many different types of assistance based on what an area needs.

Freerice does not earn or keep any money generated.

Google Scholar. 



Want to slam you anti vax aunt at Christmas this year? Google scholar can help. They have a bunch of articles about vaccines.

Bored and need inspiration for your next research project? Gooooo to gootle scholar. 


Not sure if climate change is really a thing? Google scholar has plenty of articles that prove it exists. 


Anyways, Google scholar is so important because people need to see what an actual scientific study looks like, what actual data looks like, and a real explanation on why the data matters. 



Please please please!!!! Educate yourself. I know a lot of them are hard to read but practice. You'll be so more more informed about how stuff works.
People here are talking about Cancer cure here. Stanford Medicine made the biggest breakthrough in history just last month. They cured 90 out of 90 infected mice with different kinds of cancers with just 1 shot of medicine.

Solar energy + desalination + gene therapy.
All 7 of my Honeybee colonies are currently surviving the winter, and today they’re bringing in the first pollen of the year. 

Edit: Also, please support Native Bees (for why and how at home, check out: Bringing Nature Home by Douglas Tallamy), as well as *butterflies like the Monarch, and bats!
The good news is often quiet and subtle.  The bad news is always loud.  I try to remember that.
The possible return of the American Chestnut tree. Fast growing, rot resistant and, perhaps most important, it produces enough calories from the nuts to feed a population. 

Edit: It turned out that someone from WBUR in Boston saw the interest in this post and wrote an article and made a podcast about it. It's very good!

As someone who has lost loved ones to cancer, [this.](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/01/cancer-vaccine-eliminates-tumors-in-mice.html)
My students.  They handle a complex, globally interconnected society in ways "my" generation (undergraduate at university in the 1970s) couldn't hold a candle to.  Any color, any sexual orientation, any (dis)ability, any nationality...it's all good, so long as they're not an asshole.   

We may be approximating Dr. Martin Luther King's hope for a world where people are judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin.
Bee population is on the rise. If we could work together to save the bees, we can deal with climate change.
I mean, I haven't heard much about ISIS recently. That's gotta be a good sign.
Advancements in medicine and gene therapy.  The CRISPR technology has me very excited.  Also, the James Webb Space Telescope is going to bring about many new discoveries.
Advancements in health studies and science for health has improved living conditions ten fold and continue to do so. So that makes me pretty optimistic.
Space. 

So much is unknown right now. Excited to see what can come in the future. 
Understanding of history. 
We are at a certain point in time, during which we are well aware of what happened in the past. This is a newly available, highly usefull feature of our generation. Hopefully it lasts(censorship). 
That we're almost at the point where we get artificial organs.  I could use a kidney.

Edit: guys, thanks a lot for your support, understanding and most of all the selfless offers you've made, bel it a kidney or info. I love you all.

Edit 2: I wish I could share some Resources on how to be a living donor. If someone could help me in that front so I could share it here. I'm not from the states and I don't know where to start. This is the most humbling experience I've had on reddit yet.

Edit 3: thanks to /u/ragnaruckus for this resource on living donation  https://organdonor.gov/about/process/living-donation.html

And to /u/tambourine-time for this other resource. Please, if your thinking of donating, have a look at these resources

Mental illness awareness is growing rapidly, and people are more and more willing to assist those in need.
The fact that humanity is getting another mini space race going on. I’d love to see a man set foot on Mars in my lifetime! That, and of course just getting to spend time with all my friends to play Dungeons and Dragons every week

I'm reminded of Sam's speech to Frodo in Osgiliath in the Two Towers: 
"It's like in the great stories Mr. Frodo.The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you, that meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t. Because they were holding on to something...That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for."
I'm going to nursing school and every time I hear about the advances in the medical field I get excited.  Japan just approved a medicine that they claim can cure the flu in one day. The merging of medicine and technology is extremely fascinating. I saw a video of a prototype that was virtual scan of someone's body, inside and out. You could remove organs and see what was under them. If that can catch on it will dramatically help surgeons plan for more successful outcomes. Edit to add video of scanner https://youtu.be/gJuV64B49Sk

Shared collaborative projects like Wikipedia proving that people are inherently good.
People are beginning to realize that things don't change on their own. More people are taking action to help out and change the world as a whole.
The increasing easiness of travelling anywhere in the world. 

EDIT: [This](https://youtu.be/zqE-ultsWt0) is what I'm looking forward to.

Also, nice OPTIMISM you got there you reddit bastards.
There's still people like you that donates like half of their money every year, or whatever. 🤜^^fist ^^bumb
Much to the amazement of the trauma surgeons who first received me at the hospital after I'd been found on the side of the road with a face full glass after being on the receiving end of a hit and run: 

I'm not brain dead, brain damaged, quadriplegic, paraplegic, nor did they even have to make me an amputee! 

I'm learning to walk again. The future is looking good. Until I have to go through the TSA again, that is. ;)

Reruns of Bob Ross and Mr Rogers
That every day millions of people go to work in order to provide for their families, come home, talk about inane things, etc.  The world over consists mostly of people with similar wants and similar needs no matter from where they hail or what they look like, and the vast majority of the time it just _works_.  One tiny lapse in coordination and it could all come crumbling down, but mostly the world marches on.  It's a brilliant blue ball of common humanity, and it pays to remember sometimes that for all that's horrible in the world, we're surrounded by a lot of good.
Hi Bill!

But anyway, every day we get [closer and closer](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/01/cancer-vaccine-eliminates-tumors-in-mice.html) to a cure for cancer. My mum told me about her diagnosis on Sunday. Both of her parents died of cancer too, 12 years apart.

Hopefully in the near future, it's something we won't have to worry about.

3) More than 90 percent of children now attend primary school worldwide.

4) Women now make up more than a fifth of members of parliaments around the world.

edit: I stole these from this article entitled - [Bill Gates: Here Are 5 Reasons to Be Optimistic About 2018](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/bill-gates-here-are-5-reasons-to-be-optimistic-about-2018.html). This has probably been my finest moment this year.
This is the most peaceful time in human history.  And it is getting better
The better angels of our nature. And the fact a billionaire has a platform to communicate 1v1 with everyday people. Thank you Reddit. 
/r/upliftingnews exists, and it still gets content. We should be circulating good news rather than constantly refreshing bad news.
My dog, mainly.
Internet forums like Reddit, where a one line question can pump out a thousand nice answers ranging from global improvements to cat pictures in 30 minutes. 

Also, my children and how they already have it better then I did when I was young. Even though I didn't have that much problems back then either. Keep on rocking as a great man, Bill. 
The growing acceptance of people who are different. It might be a long slow battle, but we are moving in the right direction.
A lot of people are saying SpaceX and Elon Musk without really expanding, so I will.

* Commercial Spaceflight - Its literally here right now, but its going to get even cheaper in the future. The next step will be space tourism, but that won't be accessible to the average person for a few decades at least.

* Space Construction - We've already done this with space stations, but cheaper commercial spaceflight will encourage larger buildings in space. Instead of launching completed modules like we have in the past, we're going to be launching subdivisions of modules that will dwarf even the ISS. I'm incredibly optimistic about whatever happens to be the "next ISS".

* Asteroid Mining - This one we probably won't see in our lifetimes, (unless the futurists are right, and the first person to live to 200 is alive today). However, the potential of asteroid mining is astronomical! There are individual asteroids with more platinum and tungsten on them than the entire Earth has available. Once we have these materials in excess, who knows what new developments we'll see. Aluminum used to be exceedingly difficult to refine and rare. Once a reliable refining process was developed, we found a myriad of uses for aluminum that changed the world. I predict we'll see similar benefits from improved access to rare metals found abundantly in asteroids.

* Space tourism - Now that we've got commercial spaceflight, and space construction is on the horizon, space tourism will become a booming industry. I'd be excited to spend a week on a luxury space station in the future. 

* Mars - We're definitely going at some point, whether it is publicly or privately funded. I doubt there are any monsters there, or that we'll have any visitors forced to grow potatoes with their excrement. However, Mars is the next logical destination for humanity's domination of the solar system. I hope I live to see the first colonization effort!
Most countries are steadily but surely moving upwards on the [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index). This change isn't very noticeable on a day to day basis, but over the course of decades the world is empirically becoming a better place. Not just in Western Europe, or in the prosperous bits of China, but in places like sub-Saharan Africa which are throwing aside the historical weight of colonialism, civil war, dictatorships and genocides to become better places for people to live out their lives. 
The constant technological advancement we're seeing right now, especially in fields like medicine.
Your work.  Giving away so much money is truly commendable, and I thank you for it.
The fact we still are allowed to have negative headlines...
My girl scout troop. They bring me hope that the future generation gives a shit. :) 
Whenever there's a grim news story I always remember Mr. Rodgers's mother's advice. I look for the helpers. It's a great reminder that people are inherently good and human ingenuity will get us where we need to go... eventually. 
I'm three months pregnant after the second round of IVF. The fact that my wife and I are going to have a baby together makes me ridiculously optimistic about our future.
Marijuana Legalization for the USA which will reduce crime and non-violent offenders in prison, as well as a host of other widespread positive effects.
The fact that Bill Fucking Gates is taking the time to make an Askreddit thread
Runescape mobile. 
That video of a crow and a kitten who are friends
Medical science breakthroughs in Alzheimer's and dementia.

Refocusing on space exploration. 

The future applications of automation and 3D printing.

Our increasing ability to share more complex ideas over greater distances in shorter spans of time.

ETA: Renewable energy!
Realizing that Bill Gates is the OP, meaning we can have personal conversations with people who used to be outside our reach. The world is getting smaller.
Ultrasound with the wife Thursday! 
I just saw this article this morning. Electricity usage is completely flat, and in some areas utilities will sell LESS electricity than 10 years ago. That's on top of rapidly increasing renewable sources.

https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/2/27/17052488/electricity-demand-utilities
I am hopeful that Microsoft will one day bring Clippy back into Microsoft word.
I was born with a very rare muscle illness and am rooting very hard for a cure on a genetic level. That is why I participate in any study that is thrown my way by doctors. Reading headlines on research going into human trials is very exciting and gives me great hope for the future.

Israel is now a net exporter of fresh water due to desalination technology. 
More people are actually choosing to believe proven sciences.
SpaceX
Working with people directly, I noticed a lot of them are good, generous, honest and benevolent people. These people give me the drive I need to handle things, because I know, we can shape a better future for the people, animals, and the planet.

Also puppy-gifs.
Knowledge of the past.

Humanity has made more progress towards giving people longer and better quality of life globally in the last 150 years, than has occurred in the rest of human history.
Commercialized Space Travel!
The growing research around social isolation. Writers and academics like Brené Brown and Sarah Schulman (and many more) talking about vulnerability and community. I think the more we find places to meet and speak in person, and the more we recognize the limitations of corporatized public spaces (like Facebook, Twitter), the more we can disrupt the polarized political discussions and work together and have tough conversations. And a quick plug here for my podcast [Faith Deficit](https://faithdeficit.com/) - it's me exploring questions of faith with guests from a variety of faith (and non-faith) backgrounds. I think we have to talk about all of these issues together, even if it's hard to do.

Thanks for all of the incredible work you're doing around the world, Bill. It's inspiring people like me to do our tiny little things to try to help too. :)
I am optimistic that the younger generation is more progressive than my fathers was. 
"Oi! Look at this fella..he's of the hairless variety! Rare and silky smooth to the touch, he actually likes when you rub his head! Look at his leg going!"
Wow! Get a load'a this sheila! I can imagine this one spending all of her free time sleeping in her lil' hidey hole, only coming out five times a week to spend hours at a place where she probably regrets being at in the first place, n' she'll do this most weeks of her life allllll the way up until she dies. This ones pretty big for a female too, bigger than most average males actually, don't think that gives her any luck during the mating season. * *laughs in Australian* *
I don't care, he calls me a beaut and I really needed to hear it
"Oi, Now lookie here! Notice how he seems almost entirely apathetic to my attack. That's because he spends almost every waking moment pretending not to be bothered by the current situation he is in, despite the fact that he is incredibly irritated. To him, this is just another Monday morning staff meeting! He is truly a gorgeous example of mental endurance!"
"ISN'T HE A BEAUTY?! You're alright, fella. You're alright. 

This guy is out looking for a sheila but he isn't having much luck. He's coming in late to the party."
“This little fella looks upset, but he actually craves physical contact!”

Edit: lot of you weirdos are into thumbs in buttholes.
“Oi, be very careful mates. We have to show dominance. If we show any affection towards this creature he’ll get attached to us and never leave us alone. Truly one of the most terrifying beasts in North America”
"This little bugga simulates reproduction up to 5 times a day! Almost exclusively without a mate." 

Then I imagine he would shove a Dorito in my mouth, and chuck me back into my bedroom.
“Crikey! This lil ranga is quite the sneaky little one! This particular type of animal can hide in a dark room all day and never even see the sunshine. She will do as much as she can to avoid others of her kind.”

Edit: I don’t remember what he called gingers so I fixed it, thank you for correcting me fellow redditors
Oi, this ere is a common member of ‘is species, and as you can see e’s got a fairly advanced case of fur loss, especially concentrated ‘ere at the top of his ‘ead.  Many males you find in the wild with this condition will try to compensate by growing the fur around their faces, and this fella is no different!  This one looks like he spends ‘is days being poked and nipped at by ‘is wee ones!  Note the characteristic paunchy belly and the general lack of muscle tone!  This fella can spend up to 12 hours a day grazing, and trying to find a nice spot to curl up for some shuteye

EDIT: apparently I’ve accidentally reimagined Steve Irwin as a 19th century cockney bootblack, but I’m leaving it
"Ohhhh, he's angry!! Calm down big fella. ain't gon hurtcha. Yeah, there we go. See he likes when I give his noggin scritches like this. Yeah, these guys like to get all big an blustry, especially in front of a keyboard. They'll be real mean to each other, but they're good folk though. Just gotta let them know ya care bout'em."

Everyone acting like Steve ever said something bad about the animals. That's not a thing.
"Now I now what yer thinkin', this here fella looks like an absolute killa. He's big, he's covered in hair, and if he wanted to, he could probably knock mah block off with one swing. The truth is, his kind look far more scary than they really are. Despite their size, they're actually quite timid, and will only attack when threatened and backed into a corner. Truth is, he just wants to find a Sheilah he can settle down with and, who knows, maybe have a coupla kids. Sadly, this fella hasn't had much luck lately. He's the last of his line, and it would be cryin' shame if he never got a family of his own."

\*Puts PS2 controller in my hands\*

"Luckily, here at Australia Zoo, we have a state-of-the-art gaming room, where this fella can play the video games of his youth, and relive his days as a juvenile, when life seemed so full of possibilities."

EDIT: Typed this just before I went to bed thinking I was far too late to the party to get noticed. Thanks for all the upvotes and awards! I hope this made you laugh and I'm sorry if it makes you sad. If it did, please be kind to yourself, life has a way of untangling itself. Steve would want you to care for yourself just as much as he'd want you to care for nature.
"This one right here, can put up a fight if you put a bowl Cheetos within the area. Good thing is that this bloke is actually calm because he ate a full bowl of Cheetos."
Awesome question!

This unusually large example of his species is known to consume enormous quantities of cheese in one sitting.  He is a very stealthy creature, with the ability to sit in one spot at a computer for up to 8* hours at a time. *Edit: this number has been drastically reduced size the introduction of a mate and offspring into the nest.
"Crikey!  This animal lives in a dilapidated bachelor pad and is capable of eating his weight in pudding over a weekend!"  EDIT: Thanks for the gold and the little angel thingee!
“Crikey! This is the biggest Chinese i’ve ever seen! At a whopping 6’3” and 210 pounds, this bugga has a nasty habit of eating all his brother’s food.” 

*camera pans to my anemic brother*
“Fascinating! This creature’a diet consists of almost all caffeinated beverages! And would you give a whiff of the stench coming from his bathroom! It seems this little creature eats so little fiber that its shits come out as an earthy, putrid gaseous substance!”
"This big guy is quite greasy due to his natural habitat of an engine bay. I believe he is extreamly angry due to the loss of all his 10mm sockets!"
"He's getting quite angry when he's getting poked with a stick!"

\*pokes me with a stick\*

\- "Dude, fuck off!"
"Oi! This fine specimen was a hard one to catch! Now, let's look at her. As you can see, changes make her stressed and anxious, thus more aggressive. If provoked, she'll attack on sight. She has the appetite of a Great White. She's an omnivore, but eats meat more willingly. One off thing about her diet is that she loves broccolis. She eats anything that's prepared with them."
See this is why you take physical exercise seriously kids. If you act like him and sit in front of a computer all day it’s really easy to pull a sneaky one in ya.
"This lad drinks too much."
"we have an indigenous person to the americas out of his reconstructed habitat. They were contained to a small portion of land only for this bugger to free himself from such limited space and find himself tangled in debt"
Im sitting in my chair looking at reddit on my laptop. Ive had a few beers, smoked a bowl and am relaxing.

Steve jumps out from behind the chair, tackles me and gets me in a headlock

Steve: "Easy, fella...easy, there mate"

Me: "WHAT THE FUCK DUDE"

Steve (looking at camera that isn't there and struggling): "awww, look at 'im, hes nervous, but that's all roight" "Youre all right, fella"

Steve: "this here is a common specimen, you can tell by his surroundings that he's given up on life and is just passing time until his eventual death"

Me: no longer struggling, because who cares

Steve: "notice how he has given up struggling. Listen to that..." (steve puts his ear to my mouth dramatically) "That is the wheezing of a man who hasn't done any activity in ages. Notice his surroundings...empty beer cans, crumbs on the chair, a bottle of lotion and crumpled up tissues...I think I have found his nest"

My Wife walks out of the bedroom to see Steve on top of me in the living room

Steve: "Aww look at that! There's his mate. This is a middle aged housewife who looks to be giving up a bit 'erself" Notice the frown lines and her faded nightgown"

Wife: "Fuck you, asshole!"

Steve: "Aww youre alright!"

Steve turns his attention back to the camera that isn't there

Steve: "Now each of these specimens is a little different, but judging by the items in his nest and his mate, we can tell that he hasn't had his yearly loveless sex in quite a while, and is probably suffering from mild undiagnosed depression"

Wife: "I'm calling the cops.."

Steve: "Ah Crikey! I seem to have upset his mate, so I should probably release him into the wild before i get into too much trouble out here in the bush"

Wife: "...Yeah, its some Australian guy in cargo shorts and he's beating up my husband..."

Steve: "You're alright...you're alright, aint ya"

Wife: "Yeah, he's talking to a wall like there's someone there...No I don't know...Yes, thank you, please hurry..."

Steve picks me up and guides me back to my chair

Steve: "I know i have seen these specimens many times in my career, but they always amaze me. Look how he sits there beautifully while he searches the internet for increasingly disturbing porn. Can't blame him, he's just trying to feel something...anything really. I'm always in awe how resilient these specimens are..."

My wife sobs in the corner holding her phone as I just stare at Steve Irwin

Steve: "What. A. Beauty."

Steve leaves the house, backing away slowly. Wife and I are just left wondering what the fuck happened
This creature is an easy one to spot, always in the same spot on the sofa, most commonly seen with either Reddit or Animal Crossing.
"Because of the general mess of the surroundings you might be surprised to know that this little fella here, actually build or repaired almost all this surprisingly nice furniture in this place. This species is tasteful, yet disorganized."
AYE! She's a little shy but we got her! Feed her some sugary breads and she'll calm right down even with a temper! Now her primary predator is a spider, once they see her they go right for her, in response she will aggressively scream at it until another of her species comes by to kill it. This one has been known to scream for at least 5 minutes straight even in the middle of the night. 

As you may have noticed, I caught this one on her own, that's because she screams at spiders while her neighvors and roommates are asleep.
I don't have an answer to this, but congrats. This is probably the best question ever asked on reddit.
This bloke is in a completely relaxed state. Not a care in the world.  Aw crikey! The female is home and he forgot to pick up the groceries! E’s in for it now!
 I'm really upset that most of these comments boil down to "I'm a fat, lazy incel that just sits at my computer all day." Steve would love each and every one of you and he'd have lots of interesting stuff to say about you. Even if you are a fat, lazy incel.
"Now lookie what we 'ave here! This gorgeous specimen is genuinely happy! A real gem to find in it's kinds age range. Woah boy woah, this ones got some confidence alright, and look at its gut! A true King here. I tell ya, a real chippy one this one!"

&#x200B;

I am happy and I know thats not cool here, Plz don't downvote too much Thank you (;
“This animal’s nipples are the size of small dicks, blimey!”
Amazing! This lazy bastard hasnt done laundry in weeks, or checked his email!
Oi! Av a look at this beaut! This magnificent specimen spends whuay too much toime wawtching the awfice!
ME: WHAT THE FU-

STEVE: Oi, check this fella out! 'E's struggling and struggling, 'e's a nervous feller all right! But 'e doesn't have too much muscle, or fat for that matter, so a skinny bloke like 'im doesn't take too long to subdue.

ME: OH GOD PLEASE DON'T HURT ME

STEVE: It's alright, it's alright, I ain't gonna hurt ya. This young feller never grew up with much interaction other than 'is immediate family, so that's why 'e's so scared and nervous. But don't feel bad for 'im, since leaving his natural habitat 'e's matured and 'is finding his new habitat, and sooner or later he's gonna find a nice sheilah!

ME: OH FUCK OH FU- wait, what?

STEVE: See, once you give 'im some assurance he calms down, he shows his true nature! A calm, confident fellow who only wants to prove himself to his neighbors. But little does he know, 'e's got a fine future ahead of 'im, and he's done more than enough to prove himself.

ME: Oh...uh...thanks man! I appreciate it.

STEVE: Not a problem, you're alright mate! *release*
*Here we have a wild /u/CaptainBroverdose! Once a Broverdose reaches sexual maturity, it engages in a mating ritual known as 'Making Mashups', resulting in* [*Nickelback mixed with Mario Bros and Vaporwave*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiGCXfdvjyU)
"Crikey,we got a big one!" "We've just caught a 220lb degenerate weeb from its habitat known as the Bedroom.This fella eats instant noodles and rice only and sleeps with its figurines,Rem and Astolfo body pillows....When it do sleep that is" "this kind of weeb with especially whats going on in the world,can watch 3 seasons in a day and still have time to play games instead of finishing its homework" "Welp Imma let this beauty go back to its natural habitat now"

Me:Thx Steave
This animal sleeps 12 hours a day and looks at different sizes of screens in the time he is awake.
Now the trick to not being overpowered by this wild beast is to hold your breath. It emits a noxious fume that will render you unconscious if smelt or induce vomiting if tasted
"Aahh, the North American Neck Beard. He must have run outta chicken tendas and left his nest in search of more. They're fierce shitposters but lack necessary survival skills for the wild. Usually a Karen, their mother, will do the scavenging for them due to their lack of competence."
"Crikey! This one's a beaut. Now don't pay the thrashing any mind, this sheila gets very confused when having to interact with any human but if she broke free there wouldn't be any danger, she'd just stare awkwardly for a few minutes before scurrying off.

Now what's really weird about this animal is the spikes, clearly they were meant at some point for self defence but easing of selection pressures for this species has meant these spikes are almost completely pliant. Sometimes this poor sheila's spikes can bend completely and stab her when she's trying to defend herself."
"Look at this handsome devil! It's a little known fact that this fella is capable of operatin' on as little as 3 hours of uneasy sleep! I've also observed him eat an entire mixing bowl of fried rice, passing out for the night, then waking up and still being hungry! Crikey, I know it's hard to imagine but this bloke makes it look easy!"
Honestly, I'm just scrolling through and looking for any comment by u/YourDailyDevil at this point
"Why, ain't she a bitter but, gave up right quick didn' she? This on here dyes her hair a vibrant red colour, because other members of her species compliment her on it every time she leaves her burrow! Which is important, as it encourages her to fight against her depression! That's a good girl, off with ya now!"

After he let's me go I'd probably find a place to take a nap. My stamina is quite shitty, struggling would have drained me very quickly.

"Now, this little creatchah is always looking for solitude and a way to escape human activity, so you can tell she's right pissed at me, look at her ears. You can usually find her hoidin' out in the woods and RUStliNg around the underbrush. Howevah, we can't just let her do what she loikes, we're gonna move her to a new spot with loads of her kind, 'cause I believe socialization is real important"
CRIKEY! Look at the sexual dimorphism on this bloke! Look at 'em big beauuuuutiful wiskers on this adult male. We could take a look at his dangly bits to be sure, but it's typically only the males that exhibit this feature.

Another thing I notice right off the bat is this is one of the most pale examples I've had the pleasure of dealing with. These humans tend to be very adaptive to their environments and come in all kinds of shapes and colors. The pale skin tells me this fella is likely nocturnal or at least spends most of his time hiding from the sun in some kind of den or cave or something. Notice the prehensile thumb and the orange powdery coloring at the tips of his fingers. This likely means cheetos are his primary food source. Humans tend to be omnivores and will eat just about anything.

You're a big guy, aren't ya, mate. Alright, he's thrashing around quite a bit, I think we've stressed him out. I'm going to let him go... LOOK AT HIM RUN. He's not very fast but look at the way he raises up on his hind legs to get around. What a beaut.
"Naow this fella is long and lean, which would have suited him in his previous habitat, but he has had a bit of a spat with his fiesty sheila, and naow he lives out here in what we call a "trailer in the woods." These normally social animals can become very standoffish if they endure trauma like this.  Poor bloke."
Keep an eye on this sheila! If the mood gets her roight, she’ll bite yor ‘ead off, not with ‘er teeth, but with sahcasm.

Now look at this bugguh here, surrounded by electronic screens, the nerd is most comfortable in their computer hutch. From here they can see the world, people, and goings on without any direct interaction.  Much like the owl, the nerd sits and observes. Unlike the owl, the nerd can't turn their head very far at all.
Easy girl! Easy! She's a noice girl really but she gets really nervous! Easy, easy, no one's gonna hurtcha. She's a noice girl she's just scared so she's tryna fight me, but I've got her in a strong grip so she can't get me with those strong hindfeet. You wouldn't wanna be on the end of that kick! And now I'm gonna just soothe her! Good girl! Easy, there ya go. See how she just relaxes, now she knows that I'm not gonna hurt her. 

Now we can get a good look at this girl, and the first thing you'll notice is how colourful the markings around her eyes are! She likes to use pigments to paint her eyes these byooootiful colours. Scientists used to think she did this just to attract a mate but she seems to just do it for fun! She's a byootiful lil artist. You see in her paw there...its alright girl, I'm not gonna take it from yer...you see in her other paw she's holding on to a pencil. She uses that to do gorgeous drawings! Bloomin clever! 

Right I'm gonna let her go now...thatta girl...now she knows she's not in danger, she's not gonna bite, and she's not gonna run away. And she just carries on with her drawin! And she's gonna let me sit and watcher. What a byooty!
I don't care what he tells the audience, I just want him to take his finger out my butt
“Oi she just came off a 12 hour sleep but don’t let her fool ya, she’ll eat and go right back to it. Be sure to mind your distance; this wild girl likes to bite if she’s woken.”
You guys are seeing history today folks, it’s extremely rare to see one of these leave it’s bedroom, let alone make the range of noises it made while I captured it!
can i just say this is an amazing question
“Here we have a sorry lad. Recently losing its mate, this bugga lays in its den all day long, weeping.”
“This lil’ beauty somehow managed to shed off the pounds since I last saw him! He’s got an amazing ability to read our emotions, as well as easily convey his own in astounding detail! One of his favorite meals is Tuna Ziti. What a unique lil fella! Always a pleasure spending time with him”

Then he shoves a pringle in my mouth and lets me saunter off to my gf

>!I cant beat myself down. Just cant.!<
Oi, be very careful with this big boy. When every he feels cornered by a predator or a mate, he'll throw all of his emotional baggage as a defense mechanism.
"These North American breeds have highly complex social structures. Much like bees or ants, but without the good-faith cooperation. Its high sugar diet can make it unpredictable and dangerous. They're big fellas tho aren't they?!"
This amazing creature is known as The Procrastinator in Latin it is Waitis longtimis. He is known for attending college for ten years and has yet to earn even an associates degree. The Procrastinator has been known to take down more than a quarter ounce of weed per day sometimes more if he gets really bored or it’s shark week. Be very careful leaving your food around this one. He will kill a burger and fries in the time it takes you to wash your hands. There are maybe a handful of these lazy ass creatures left on this planet. Thank God for that.
"Shhh. Look here at this beautiful creature. Many people misunderstand this little guy because any contact and he may shutdown completely, however if you approach slowly and quietly...look at that, give em a little scratch on his head and he's completely wrapped himself around me and fallen asleep."

-falling asleep in Steve's arms is the most comforting thought I can imagine. I envy all the animals that had that with him.
The wild Strawberrycocoa is known to drink 1/5th of his bodyweight in coffee a day
Ahh, this fella right here likes wearing his wife’s underwear.
All right, look this here is one of em bachelor Canucks. Rarely ever seen outside of his one bedroom apartment for which he pays too much for and can't find a job because a pandemic has ravaged his society. Now what's interesting is he's also what we call an insomniac and is afraid of romantic commitment with his kind. To cope with all this "anxiety", this Canuck uses lots of cannabis as you can tell by his lethargic state and red eyes.
"You'll notice this wee fella isn't fighting back. That's because all of his fighting methods are rendered useless without a keyboard & mouse. The Esportis Streamajourus is a docile creature"
Crickey! Look at this one. He has 7 extra teeth than a normal one and is trying to grab at me with his toes. Edit changed from 6 to 7 apparently that one that hadn’t breached yet had, never noticed. 4 wisdom teeth and now 3 teeth in a second row two on my right side and one on the left.
“This one ‘ere’s a rather tricky bugga! If left alone near an object it could use to harm itself,it’s quite prone to doing so. If it doesn’t,it will either spend its time recreating procreation without a mate or performing the interesting feat of eating up to three times its weight in food!”
“Shhh, quiet with this one.  See the way that one is curled ‘round ‘erself in the corner?  We have to be real careful with this one, she’s fragile.  OI! It seems she’s about to eat ‘er own young as a response to stress.  Let’s back quietly away, this could get real dangerous, mate.”
Crikey! This one’s tough to get ahold of! They’re shy but compassionate individuals! They won’t come up to you or actively seek you out but if you go up to one of em’, they’re the friendliest creatures I’ve ever met! They love to sleep a lot, but don’t wake em’ up because they’ll get a lil’ cranky. These guys love to be held so don’t be shy to pick one up if ya ever encounter one!
“This ones a slimy one! He masturbates constantly!”

At face value I would think it's a good idea, but I saw someone pointed out a rather logical reason why it wouldn't: basically the wealthier representatives could wait out the poorer ones.
A better solution would be to cancel recess for everybody involved.

Edit: Just to clarify, ~~recess~~ removing recess means that the senate cannot adjourn.
I would prefer that Congress can't leave the Capitol until a budget is passed. 
I think that could turn into a game of big bank little bank.  The wealthiest politicians could just wait out those with less money in order to get their way.  
The whole reason they don’t already is because then the richer congressmen would use it against the poorer ones. Terrible idea.
I'd rather change the law so that not passing the budget defaulted to a continuing resolution.  There is no reason a shut down should happen.  
No, but I'm also against allowing critical federal employees to go without pay. I think if they're required to work, we should be required to pay them.

Regarding the "why not" of politicians - we're finally starting to get some who *aren't* coming from wealth. I'd hate for those people to get pushed out because they can't afford to be politicians. I want to see more representation of working and middle class people in our government.

Obligatory update: Thanks for the silver, kind internet stranger!

Functionally - you would need an amendment rather than just a law.

Congressional members aren't paid from annual appropriations and are paid through a salary not based on hours worked, but as their status as members. More importantly, members of Congress are constitutional officers. The President (and life-tenured federal judges) is also a constitutional officer and also cannot be prevented from carrying out their duties except as allowed in the Constitution. As such, they're all constitutionally entitled to pay.

Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution:

>The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.

27th Amendment:

>No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.

It also functionally wouldn't do much besides perhaps damage the one or two financially untenable younger members (AOC for example). The shutdown and pay being withheld impact only those employees that *need* that money imminently, which is not the vast majority of Congress and certainly not the President. So that amendment would functionally not be much more than a feel-good effort.
I personally like the Canadian system.  If their legislature ever fails to pass a budget, they've failed at their primary responsibility of running the government.  Failing to pass a budget is treated as a failure of confidence, and a general election is triggered whereby every parliamentarian must face their voters and rejustify why they should have a job.

&#x200B;

Not saying that would force all U.S. legislators to act, but it would probably incentivize enough to avoid stupid shit like this latest shutdown.
This is a terrible idea.

For one thing, most of them would not care. My Senators are worth millions of dollars, they don't even notice their salary.

For another thing, *some* Congresspeople do really depend on their salary. This is their only source of income.

See the problem here? If we cut off their pay then the rich Congressmen have a weapon to use against the poorer Congressmen. There would be *more* government shutdowns and threats of shutdowns, and "vote with me or lose your paycheck" would become a viable, common tactic for the wealthier members of Congress.

A better idea would be to just stop voting for idiots. Or, more applicable to this audience: fucking vote.

Edit: Thank you for the gold and silver, and the great discussions! This shutdown is extremely frustrating for everyone, and there are no easy answers. But the more we talk about potential solutions, the more likely we are to find some that work. 
This simple argument against it is that newer or less corrupt congressmen would be the only ones to suffer. If you're making 500K selling your soul to a big corporation, than your check for being a part of congress is an after thought. Mean while freshmen senators who realistically spent nearly all of their money on campaigning to get into congress and change a broken system will be the only ones to suffer. 

So this could just help the spread of corruption against high ranking government members. Although why should they be exempt from suffering the way TSA workers or Prison workers do?

I feel that instead of stopping anyone from getting payed, if a budget isn't agreed upon, than we have an emergency 3 months airbag where we pay federal workers for those 3 months and essentially use the previous budget. If those 3 months go by and still no movement is made, then there should be repercussions for congress and the presidency. Something along the lines of an immediate replacement of all leading members of congress and a removal of the current president. This later one is dangerous because there are times that congress would be willing to kill it's self to kick a sitting president out of power, such as republicans during the Obama administration, and I suspect Democrats during the Trump administration.

Additionally congress should be forced into a minimum of 8 hour work days with the president sitting in on the meeting trying to find a compromise. There should be no vacations, time off, or excuses with the exception of terminal illness. If a member of congress fails to show up, they would effectively be removed from congress, and if the sitting President or Vice President is not there than their power to veto a budget will be removed and it would only take both houses to confirm a budget.
I don't think the whole shutdown concept should even exist. Budgets for projects with limited lifetimes should end, but operating budgets for ongoing departments and agencies should run along as-is until changed. There should never be a budget/no-budget conflict. It should be about how much we spend or don't spend on each individual thing. 
I support a law that ends shutdowns by continuing funding at previous levels if no new budget is passed
[deleted]
I like the idea, but I don't think it would do a whole lot. First, there would be some Constitutional issues with regards to the 27th Amendment. I think you could phrase it so that you can comply with the 27th Amendment, but there would certainly be court challenges that you would have to spend time and energy fighting.

Beyond that, though, Senators, Representatives, and Presidents aren't really dependent on their salaries. The majority of them are either independently wealthy or make a ton of money off capital gains (ie investments). I don't think holding their salary would change their standard of living in the slightest.
I'd be more in favor of holding an impromptu election like other countries do. If a Congress can't work together to keep the govt open at a minimum, why not revote and whoever the public decides is the problem gets thrown out?
Here's the thing: I only think it would work if you eliminated income from all sources, i.e. investments and outside revenue streams.  Basically you'd have to put a freeze on the bank accounts of the politicians during a shutdown, and you'd never have one again.  At least half of our members of Congress have such wherewithal that their congressional salary is meaningless to them.
The cost of voting to shutdown the government should be the calling of new elections.
How about instead of a "shut down", no one leaves the room until shit gets resolved?

And honestly, calling it a "shut down" is such bullshit. All the employees (who aren't getting paid right now) still must come in to work. They still take taxes out of my paychecks. The military is still doing it's military thing. The border patrols are still patrolling. The USPS is still shipping packages and mail. If the government was really shut down, none of that stuff should be going on.
No. Corrupt politicians would have advantage over honest ones. Honest ones might find it easier to get money illegitimately than to solve the shutdown problem, which corrupt politicians would love.
I'm generally in favor of the idea that Congress should be bound by every law it passes.  They get to use the things they pass for the rest of us: health care, the retirement, hiring practices, etc.  No exceptions for the "special people".
Absolutely not.  As others have said, the problem with anything that punishes senators financially is that it encourages wealthy people to get involved in politics, and discourages less wealthy ones - or leaves them dependent on wealthy patrons, which is even worse.

Instead, when the government fails to pass a budget, everything should continue at previous levels (maybe even automatically increasing for inflation.)  This is not ideal, but defaulting to the status quo is far superior to having everything grind to a halt - people who want to implement changes should have to get support for them and shouldn't be able to use shutting down the government as a cudgel to try and force them through.

The tons of long term millionaire congressmen would love to hamstring the newly elected like EOC that truly depend on their salaries in such a way.  

Knee jerk reaction is yes...but actually it would be more  leverage for a manufactured shutdown.
Yes, I also think they should have to purchase insurance through the same markets as everyone else.

I also don't think they should be able to vote for their own raises. 
How about we don't pay taxes during a shutdown. 
I would rather we just do away with the debt ceiling bullshit and not allow Congress and the president to use these continuing resolutions to hold the government (employees, services, etc) hostage. Its a ridiculously a stupid policy and serves as nothing more than a manipulation and bargaining strategy. Do your negotiating and bargaining while drafting the budget and then stick with it until the following fiscal year. Procedures can be put in place for emergency funding of unexpected events such as extreme natural disasters. 
Government shuts down they all get fired.

See if that motivates them to work together. 
How about remove all government paid travel and remove all pay/benefits?

Insane that the secret service protecting these officials are not being paid as they fly around on taxpayers expense.

Insane homeland security and other law enforcement personnel are not being paid while having to work.
Introduce supply.

If there cannot be made a budget within two weeks, after two weeks elapse, approval from the President is no longer required to pass a budget. And two weeks after that, Congress is dissolved for special elections for all seats that will be up for election at the next election.
No, because this whole process is fucking stupid and shouldn't have to happen in the first place. If they can't pass a budget, last year's budget should roll over and take it's place. This crap is rediculous.
The president should have to vacate the White House during a shutdown and be sequestered in a Motel 6 with Congress until everything is solved. Everyone has to share beds.
[deleted]
The government shouldn't even be shut down in the first place. There should be a law that just rolls over the previous year's budget if an agreement can't be reached on a new one.
As long as I can still taxidermy my body when I'm dead, they can have my organs. 
You know exactly how reddit feels about that shit
My organs are free for all if anyone needs them.
It's interesting, because this is actually very similar to their state church system. Icelanders are automatically registered as a member of their mother's church upon birth and have to opt out if they don't want to be registered as a church member. My Icelandic friends and I call it "Christian by default". Leads to a lot of interesting cultural and religious views of what it means to be religious or not.  Most people don't unregister, but just never go to church. And the churches registered with the government still receive money from the state for anyone registered as congregants/members. Churches receive roughly $7.00 per month per registered individual - regardless if they regularly attend or not. Only in recent years have people started to actually bother unregistering from their churches.
As long as the ability to opt out is easy and evident, I don't care.


Edit: Thanks for the upvotes everyone!!! I really did not expect my opinion to be appreciated by so many people.

I did read most of the comments and responded to some. It seems a lots of people can't think of a reason to opt out. The only answer I have to that is everyone has their own view on life and may have different views then the majority.
Just out of curiosity, what would this mean in a Jane/John Doe type situation?
There seems to be this weird stigma that people have where they think that if they are an organ donor and the ER folks see that when trying to save their life, that for whatever reason they'll half-ass it so they can get their organs.  I've never understood it, but this seems like a good way to handle that.  Let people choose **not** to be helpful postmortem instead of them having to choose **to** be.
I've always said that this should be the way.

I got an extra 13 years with my dad thanks to someone else's heart.

**edit**  I'm going to do my best to get back to every responder to this comment.

It's almost exactly a year to the day that my dad died, and you've (mostly) all made me tear up with your comments and stories.

#IF YOU WANT TO BE AN ORGAN DONOR, MAKE SURE YOUR FAMILY KNOWS ABOUT IT NOW.
[deleted]
I don’t know, my heart’s just not in it. 

Edit: on a serious note, it’s a great idea. 
Smart idea. If you care enough to not be an organ donor, you can just opt out. This just encreases the pool by adding the folk who don't care. I do believe there should be a clause added for those who could not reasonably be asked to give consent in the first place.
How do I feel about (EXTREMELY POPULAR OPINION)?

oh Reddit, you never change. Not even the wording 


How do you feel about this?
We've had this in Wales since 2015. I can't remember anyone disagreeing with it.
I once went to a Service Ontario here in Canada and the person in front of me opted out to be an organ donor. The service lady at the desk was pretty loud when saying “ok sir, YOU ARE NO LONGER AN ORGAN DONOR.” Everyone stared. This could be seen as publicly shaming the man. 
Reminder to sort by "controversial" for the interesting discussions
I'd opt out immediately.. Just not comfortable with the idea. Don't take my choice away from me. 
I have a question for everyone who upvoted and commented on this. How many of you are organ donors?
I'm in Portugal, we already do this, it has never been an issue as far as I recall
it's the same in the Netherlands. It's a good thing- people can opt out, and also, the relatives of a deceased person can still decide to opt out if they want to. Many people aren't against this, but don't really want to think about it or make an effort while alive, and organs are needed hard!
When my brother killed himself the hospital was incredibly pushy and pressured my grieving mother to let them harvest him. 

They took away our chance to say goodbye, and they botched the procedure and ruined ALL of his organs by not putting him on a ventilator. Then they billed us $30,000 for butchering him and refused to budge on the bill. We still can't even collect his estate because of the hospital bills from them cutting him apart against his wishes. 

He was dead before he ever arrived and they still found a way to charge us for a surgery. 

Its not ridiculous to think those people would let you die for your organs. They absolutely fucking will. I've seen the way they get when they think they have someone they can use. I don't doubt for a second that they would have pushed us to pull the plug if he was on life support. 

Don't have so much faith in these people. They're highly paid and see you as a profit center. They only care about how much they can bill your insurance company. 

Fuck St Mary's hospital in West Palm Beach Florida. 

I'm from Austria and it's been like this over here for as long as I can remember. Honestly, there is no issue. Very few people actively don't want to be donors. They care enough to just opt out. Most people don't care whether or not their organs are donated/don't think about it and would be too lazy to opt in if it weren't automatic. I literally see no reason against it and anyone I've ever talked to about our system has expressed the same opinion. It's beyond me why it's not a thing in more countries. 

Edit: TIL it's more widespread than I thought. I hope it's going to become even more common! 
I'm not a fan of having to opt out of something you didn't sign up for in the first place. The onus shouldn't be on the non-consenting party.

I am an organ donor myself, and encourage everyone to be organ donors. However, I know that many people and their families have personal reasons for not wanting to be donors. Despite the ability to opt out, there will still be cases of people who didn't get around to opting out or maybe weren't even aware that they are compulsory donors.

Also, if people with mental illnesses or cognitive disabilities aren't automatically opted out, this raises *many* ethical issues.
Not a fan; it violates the idea of free choice over ones body. How can the logic of "my body my choice" be applied to abortion but not to your own bodily organs?
If I’m dead I don’t need my organs. 
I have to disagree.  While morally I think it is great to have organs more readily available, I think you should NOT automatically be opted in.

My feelings on this stem from the technology industry.

Apps, Windows (microsoft), browsers, video games, they all automatically opt you in to their information gathering, email sending, text message viewing, invasive "services".

I personally think it should be illegal to have anyone automatically opt me in for anything.  Everything should be a default NO until I otherwise give my consent to it.

It also should be illegal to give out other people's information under the guise of "if you recommend 5 friends, you get a free t-shirt".  Because then all the sudden I am getting spam calls from Gyms, Window companies, scammers, all because some asshole that has my number decided to put me down as a recommendation.  Even asking to take me off lists, I still get calls.

Yes I am an organ donor.  Yes I wish more people were.  But No, I don't beleive anyone should be automatically opted in for anything.

No one should have to spend time, energy, or have to navigate tricky menus just to opt out of something they never agreed to in the first place.  Even if it is a simple 5 minutes of your time with an easy to navigate website.  Most companies/places bank on people not paying attention/not knowing in the first place.
I don't really care but I do have a funny story. When I was 16 I was with my dad getting my driver's license. The lady asked me "Do you want to be an organ donor?" I looked at my dad, horrified, and said "When does that operation take place?"
Unpopular opinion but: I do not like it.

&#x200B;

I am all for organs going to those that need it, and I would hate for organs to decompose and go to waste. 

&#x200B;

But I am very much against the notion that you are automatically subscribed to becoming an organ donor, this would suggest they would have an automatic claim over your body unless you opt out. I principally believe that they do not and should not have any claim to my organs and body unless I willingly opt myself in.
I think it’s great to have more donors and I’ll get hated for this but, I want to be complete when I’m buried. Please respect my selfish wish.
We’ve had this in Wales (Part of UK) for a few years now. 
I don’t know, what if there was a law where all your possessions went automatically to the state upon your death unless you specifically opted out and said it goes to your spouse and kids. Such systems may lack accessibility for many people, and others may not even know about the fact they are automatically opted in. It also seems to reduce the medical idea of body autonomy, so for these reasons I’d say no
While it is a good idea for saving lives, I feel like the government automatically opting in is kind of an overreach of powers.
In Sweden, we celebrate Christmas for 20 days which results in us celebrating the end of Christmas on the 13th of January. Up until then, you’re supposed to keep the Christmas decorations up.
I used to work as an assistant to people with various mental challenges, this one guy kept his decorations up 365 days a year. Nothing like chilling in the living room in July and there's a fully lighted and decorated Christmas tree standing there
The tree actually looks really nice where it is. We might just move it to a corner and take the decorations off of it
Santa lives in my house, he makes baseball bats for the kids, i wouldn’t want to offend him.
My mother in law actually hasn’t taken them down since Christmas 2019. At this stage my ears have become pointed and I’ve actually lost some height.
Christmas hasn't arrived for us yet. so jokes on you.
I never got around to taking them down.
You’re supposed to leave your tree up until Epiphany.
Um..  there are twelve days of Christmas.  Today is day number two.
It's still Christmas in my country we have 2 days
Figured I'd save myself the time and just leave them up. Plus the lights are pretty.
Supposed to take everything down on '3 kings day' which IIRC is Jan 7th.
I keep the Twelve Days of Christmas, personally!
cuz its 12 days of christmas! To us, christmas really ends when the three mages show up, so the 6th of January. also St stephen or smth
Weather glitched up and now seasons are undefined
[deleted]
Damn, dad, that joke was much funnier in 1983.
The 12 days of Christmas start on the 25th.
How does this shit get so many awards every year?
The twelve days of Christmas actually starts on Christmas Day which means it wouldn't end until the 5th of January.
God I hate Reddit
jokes on you its 2nd christmas day here.
What are you talking about it's second Christmas day today
We adopted a kitten and she seems to like the Christmas decor so we might just leave them.
Gotta be prepared in case those godless communists try to cancel Christmas, I'm ready to stun them with my 250,000 light multi-media extravaganza pious tribute to the savior.

Whoops!  A bulb burned out.  Gotta run.
The Christmas season ends on Jan 9, 2021 before the Feast of Jesus’ Baptism. That’s 16 days of Christmas total, and I’m getting my money’s worth.
They've already been up for ~750 days, what's another year on the pile?
Merry Christmas. It goes for a minimum of 12 days. You know the song? Great!
This is the most unfunny and overrated post ever
We're still on the second day of Christmas. Tomorrow is the third day.
It is still Christmas for eleven more days.
Goodness, this sub is so lame now. 

All it is now is a place for people to peddle their *qwerky* questions but mask it as they're actually asking a question for discussion.

OP doesn't give a shit about answers... he's just refreshing the page every 5 seconds, masturbating to the attention he's getting. 

OP, why do you need the validation of strangers to feel good? Where's your confidence and self-esteem? Go find that instead of shitposting on reddit.
Anything that brings me joy during quarantine stays
I'm not taking them down because I work in a hospital so I didn't get to see my family or get to do anything except cry and be depressed and get worked to death while everyone is out traveling to see their families without masks, while my own Covid positive Father has been laying in a hospital bed for a month. Therefore, the holidays didn't exist for me this year.  

Why deny the little joy it brings me when I can have a year round tree lamp to stare at after learning how many people died today. 

My lights are staying up and my fake tree is my new reading lamp. I deserve 365 more days of light to guide me through this clusterfuck of hell people have created because they can't bear to stay the fuck home or do something as simple as wear a mask.
So funny and original!!! Lolz
In my house Christmas lasts until new years eve
cringe
..........I just wanna know why this managed to get upvoted
Wait you guys aren't preparing for Christmas 2024 yet?
it's still the second christmas day, in germany we celebrate the 25th and 26th but open presents on the 24th
It is still Christmas until the epiphany - the 6th of January.
I figure if my neighbor can fly Trump flags and have Trump signs in the ground, why not Christmas decorations.
Given this year it is very bild of you to assume there are 364 days left......
I'm too busy playing with my new toys.
Its only the 2nd day of Christmas, we get 12...
You’re supposed to leave it up until the Epiphany. It’s only the 2nd day of the 12 days of Christmas, ya filthy heathen!
There are 12 days of Christmas that BEGIN on Dec. 25th. Christmastide (as the 12 days are known) ends with Three Kings Day on Jan. 6th. The tree stays up til then or til Candlemas Feb. 1st according to some traditions. Either way, it's up now because IT'S STILL CHRISTMAS.
The real question is why yours are not up.  You mean old cotton-headed ninny muggins.
One less thing to worry about
Because Ed Asner said it was time to start preparing for next Christmas.
Boy Scouts are always prepared
Do you really think I'm the kind of person to take them down? I haven't even showered since last year.
The same reason that the clock in my car is still an hour fast- it'll change again soon so theres no point now
Didn’t put any up, jokes on you
It's bad luck to take them down before  Epiphany.   It's right there in the Nicene confession. 

&#x200B;

Seriously:  I had a neighbor who believed this.   I assumed it's an ethnic thing but I didn't ask.
It’s only the second day of Christmas, decorations stay up until Epiphany on January 6th in this house.
On the 364th day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...
Game. Set. Match.
As someone who just ordered 1800 bucks of rgb pixel lights I can't wait. 😂🤔
Christmas is twelve days. There’s a little-known song about it.
Christmas Spirit and a lack of self control
Lame
I kept mine up form late year.
Just keep adding decorations u til I can't see my floor anymore!
Does the OP think hes funny?
My Christmas decorations are great for New Years too. Plus, ny family takes them down on Three Kings Day (January 6th).
In norway we take down Christmas decorations on the 13th day usually
It's the 12 days of Christmas
[deleted]
it seems just like yesterday
Not sure if this is a joke post. Who the fuck takes their decorations down the day after Christmas?
I’m was just too lazy to take mine down after last Christmas
Take my up-vote an get out, ya filthy animal.
My illuminated Christmas Otter stays up until the twelfth day of Christmas, January 6th. It is known as the Epiphany, this when the Three Wise Men showed up. This is also the First Night of Carnival, my Mardi Gras flag goes up that night.
Still eleven days of Christmas left!!
Cause we are only in day 2/12 of Christmas.  I am waiting for those wise guys before I take mine down ;)
I actually put mine up 729 days in advance. I'm getting a head start on Christmas 2022
Because Christmas isn't over yet! It's 'tweede kerstdag' (second Christmas day)!
Hard to argue with this post
Technically speaking... the 12th day of Christmas is January 5th.  So a better question would be, why are they down already?
Because it's 194 days until Christmas in July.

By the time we get these all taken down we'll have to start putting them back up again.
Because I haven't taken them down yet?
Christmas doesn't end on Christmas Day. It's just the 'first' day according to the 12 days of Christmas. The actual end is the Epiphany, which is the 6th January.
I used to live in an apartment with terrible lighting. I kept the Christmas tree up all year so I could see.
Fuck you take my upvote
HAHAHAHHAA ITS SO FUNNY GUYS DO YOU GET IT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣you see every one still has all of their decorations up because it has only been one day since Christmas. But since the holiday only happens once a year on the 25 of December there is almost one entire year until the next Christmas so its weird how the everyone is prepared for an event that is so far away.

Tldr: your not funny
What a shit joke
Put this on a different sub karma whore

My enneagram is a type 6 and I like to plan and prepare as far ahead of time as possible. It's just my nature.
Because a Christmas tree makes an amazing night light when I have to go pee at three in the morning. No more stumbling in the dark for me!
Because on the 6th is the day most people Open the presents.
It's still Christmas here, we have 2 days of Christmas in the Netherlands. So, don't know what you're talking about.
I was gifted from an older friend with the biggest heart a cheap LED usb tree.  It’s not awesome looking or even standing straight, but I’ve kept that thing on like a night light for over two years now and have no intention of putting it away ever. Times have gone to shite for the two of us but that tree is one good memory at least up at all times.
Because I'm a lazy piece of shit and leave my christmas stuff up all year. I just put stuff over it to mask it but it's always there waiting on the next one.
My ladder is trapped under a pile of torn wrapping paper
Because they've been up for 3 years now and at this point it's just the way my lounge looks now.
my stepbrother has had his xmas lights up in his room since xmas 2019
If you keep the lights up in the middle of the summer it’s really easy to give directions to your house since it’s the only house with Christmas lights up
Don't be such a grinch
You ain't gotta get ready for Christmas if you stay ready for Christmas...
I... may or may not have halloween decorations still up...
I just paint my tree red for Valentines day. Never too early to celebrate.
So my father can get pissed off on Easter and throw the Christmas Tree from the unused living room down the stairs, just like when I was a kid.
Chill, we don’t have to take anything down until New Years at my house and decorating for Christmas doesn’t start until Thanksgiving is over.
Taps head dont have to put em up if you never take em down
I bought Christmas pillows for my couch last year. After Christmas I thought about taking them off and putting them away in a closet, but then I took a nap using one of the pillows. It was more comfortable than any of the other pillows I owned, so I just left them on my couch the whole year.
My younger brother is currently in in patient rehab, but he  is getting out next week, he just turned 18 so we're going to do a combined Christmas and birthday celebration with him! For anybody struggling with addiction of any kind, know there are people out here to help out, even myself. Happy holidays folks! Stay healthy and warm.
Galaxy brain here asking the right questions.
Because my wife sure as fuck ain't taking them down, and I didn't put them there. 

Last time we has Christmas lights up, they were there for 3 years.
Jokes on you, my husband takes them down today. It's the weirdest thing I had to get used to. But all Christmas decorations are gone and put away.
In the Netherlands we celebrate Christmas two days

There was a post on r/aww of a gorilla using sign language to tell people not to feed it or something to that effect.

This one guy was on the toilet, and he sneezed while he was taking a shit. That same moment, the power in his house went out. He proceeded to cry because he thought he shit himself blind.
Maybe someone can help me find the actual post. It was from 5 years ago on a post about what you would do with a specific amount of money (like 5 million dollars in a lottery)

[That time](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/) a person on r/formula1 asked *"If you could eliminate a race within the year, which would it be, and why?"* which looked rather bad when taken out of context, especially in r/all

Someone rin r/homeowners trying to get rid of ants in their house.  Tons of comments.  One fellow redditor suggested maybe there were no ants, that they were hallucinations due to carbon monoxide poisoning.  OP had his house tested and turns out there were, in fact, no ants and he was hallucinating them due to carbon monoxide poisoning.
I can’t remember everything about the post or even which sub it was in, but I think about this one a lot. 

OP was staying in a hotel and the person in the room next to them was blasting Sesame Street. They suddenly heard a grown man yell, “god dammit Mister Noodle!!!”

"I always say don't be afraid of failure, because how far can you really fall? You found out - to the ground. It's right there. Now you know it isn't anything that should scare you."
Believe I saw it on reddit, a IT tech related post. 

Guy starts a new job as a system admin, no other IT at the place, previous admin had been there for just about fucking forever and left behind some documentation, but not enough to make the job easy. The guy finds a note from the previous tech with a few misc tips, and then says "if there is a critical emergency and everything else has failed, there is a box in the server room behind the switch, open only as a last resort."

Guy is there for a few years, metaphorical fires get fixed, he learns the tricks of the place, but one day the server doesnt boot, tries everything, cant get it to work, all the files are there, the company cant function, actual fires are about to start. Guy freaks out and remembers the emergency box and figures now should be an emergency and figures maybe the guy left access info to offsite backups or tape drives or some sort of disaster recovery and goes into the server room. Behind the switch is a box, pulls it out and opens it to find a bottle of tequila.
I still love the r/showerthoughts post.

I can't find the post, but it was a man whose son was born evil. They knew it right away, born in the 70s, I believe. When he (the son) was older, he tried to kill his baby sister (or something?) and the mom started to beat him up. The dad left the room and waited until she stopped. She came out twenty minutes later and he said "is he dead?" She said "my god I hope so". They locked themselves downstairs for two weeks, listening to him move around a little bit here and there. After two weeks he left and they never saw him again.

It was a post in r/AmItheAsshole where an uber driver drove a girl to a restaurant where she was meeting her boyfriend. Before he dropped her off, he gave her a respectful comment (nothing inappropriate and without any bad intentions). He was asking if he was the asshole and the answer was no.

The best part happened in the comments section where somebody asked if he was living in a specific city. He replied a little freaked out with yes. Turn out it was the stranger cousin that he gave the compliment to. After he dropped her of at the restaurant, she went inside to meet her boyfriend. However it wasn't a nice night because he broke up with her. She told her cousin that the compliment that her uber driver gave her gave her some comfort or made her happy or something like that.

The girl and the uber driver then contacted each other through the cousin.

I don't know what happened afterwards but if somebody knows this post, I will give you a virtual hug if you could link it.

The story of u/jasoninhell is one of the saddest stories that I have read on the internet.

If you guys don't know the story u/Jasoninhell was a fellow Reddit user that posted his story regarding his wife's cheating with his neighbor on r/relationship_advice. r/relationship_advice told him that he will be better off divorcing his wife than to deal with her.  

A few days later he posts something on r/legaladvice to see how he can secure custody of his two children during the divorce.

His wife, named Brandi worley, found the r/legaladvice thread. 

The same day she found the reddit posts she kills both kids to spite her soon to be ex husband.

Brandi then calls 911 telling the operator that she stabbed herself and her 2 children because her husband was divorcing her, the call was recorded with Brandi showing no remorse or emotion during the call.

This whole situation was unfolding live on reddit and 4chan 

Brandi was given 120 years in prison with the jury saying "She doesn't regret her decision not one bit."

A recent one, but that 40 something year old guy who bought like, 5 Peleton bikes to give to the family of his 21 year old Eastern European wife because they told him it was tradition in their country
There was a guy on AITA that had a son with his ex wife and he moved away and started a new family. This man was a mechanic his whole life and with his first son had promised him when he was like 4-6 that he’d get this sweet car they’d worked on. Instead he gives it to his 16 year old son from the second marriage and his first son was FURIOUS. Like never speaking to you again furious. Dad was dumbfounded. Then the son sent him a video where dad promised him the car at his birthday party. Turns out his first son went to school to be a mechanic like his dad. THIS MFER had never even once asked what his son was doing with his life. 

I’ve never been so sad reading a story on reddit.

one time on r/relationship_advice some guy posted a thread called   
“My (25M) girlfriend 26F baked all the beans, now I consider to end our relations? What do I do?”  
its deleted now though but i still have the full post.

i discovered this in another one of these askreddit posts but honestly its too good not to put here. now without further ado, here it is:  


Hello,

My girlfriend and me have done dating for 5 month. I thought "This girl is very good," and became of love with her.

Yet even so, on this Monday, I comed home and found she as baked all my beans.

Yes, all. Oh brother.

In my cupboard I store several bag of bean, to make soft and to bake on some days, to have a bit of baked bean on my dinner. Or, heck, a lunch too some days.

But on the Monday I find this girlfriend baked all the beans. I say "Why do you bake my beans", and she say something as "I bakes them good to save time, so I bakes them all now."

I am astonished and full of dissmay. I say "I canfr not eat all the beans", she say she is froze many of the beans so as we can unfrozen the on a later day and eat some at a time.

But, if a bean is froze and unfrozed, the very good and very nice flavor of bean is gone far.

A bean is best if baked fresh as a Sunday Pie. Not to be froze and unfroze!

I told my girfriend I am so sad of this, as to my opinion the baking of the beans and to freeze them has ruin all my beans. She say I am "gone haywire" by my enragement and sad manners.

But I hates what she did to my beans.

On the days before Monday I thought "Will we marry the girlfriend? Well it might be so."

But now I am so sad she baked them beans. I am consider to end our relations and not be the boyfriend and girlfriend any more. But, is my idea wrong? Could my girlfriend make promise to not bake the beans? I do not know what doing to do and how to feel forgiving on her.

So way back when (2008-2009?), some redditor got very excited over his 2 AM chili and posted an extensive tutorial, in full 'fuck yeah bell peppers' style. Naturally, this became a meme. 

Concurrently, another redditor posted nothing less than the life hack of the century: freeze a block of water, squirt shower gel on top, freeze that, and now you have Ice Soap (TM). This was a fine enough goof, but the OP's insistence that this was much more efficient than putting shower gel on one's body made it become a meme.

So what happens when two memes are popular at the same time? Exactly.

*Someone froze a block of chili and rubbed their body with it*. And achieved the coveted #1 spot. This site is weird like that.

The man who redirected an entire warship to get the sun off his eyes:

&#x200B;

> I was once on a US military ship, having breakfast in the wardroom (officers lounge) when the Operations Officer (OPS) walks in. This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel. He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious. My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face. He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today. It's painful to watch. But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge. In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says "heeeey. It's OPS. Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five. Thanks." And puts the phone down. And then he just sits there. Squinting. Waiting. And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him. After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me. By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face. He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel. I am in awe. He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour). But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel. 

i still think about it sometimes.
Some guy in r/unpopularopinion says that wearing socks in the shower feels great.

EA's micro-transaction post.
You like that, you fucking retard?
I remember one where some guy did some rendering of animation or something for iirc Disney and they paid him a bunch of money to basically do nothing but run some program on his computer. He then for reddit karma turned a not yet released bit of animation into a meme and Disney found out about it and fired him so he ended up having to deliver mail. If anyone remembers that one and can find a link please do.

There was this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jatvd/i_am_not_proud_of_my_son/?ampcid=1*1soo0nf*cid*RTJUVFQwZTEwckVjX3hqU1ZLcEw5M3NhT1RxSnZZMDhXWmN6Y20zOXhBQ0Z0MTBVY0puMGV6YzBWa2V0X1RDZg) in r/confessions from a guy who hates his son and will never be proud of him no matter what, even though said son has finally gotten off drugs and the streets (and turns out for good reason).

It always stuck with me, not sure why - maybe the man’s pure anguish and rage, but more so I’ve always had a positive outlook on things and am drawn to feel good stories of recovery, forgiveness, reunion, etc. pretty much the “return of the prodigal son.” But I never really thought about how those stories gloss over the pain and resentment of victims who are unable to forgive unforgivable actions but are inadvertently made to feel guilty and ashamed for feeling that way. We just kind of expect them to just automatically be the bigger person, eventually come to forgive, move on, if not now then with the passage of the years etc. I had never thought of that before that post. And maybe the uncomfortable reminder that sometimes people are just rotten from their core.
Dude helps his sister move and finds a strange 'hook' in her closet and asks r/whatisthisthing for advice lmao. Turns out to be a intense BDSM anal hook

There was a guy (I believe he was a nurse) who wrote about the time he was eating out his girlfriend and she squirted when she came. 

Apparently it’s less parts female ejaculation than it is just straight up pee, and the OP noted it tasted very sweet. He asked if she was diabetic. She wasn’t. He told her to get her blood sugar levels tested and inadvertently saved her life. She had undetected diabetes. 

Orgasms save lives, kids.
The one where the guy felt violated because he agreed to poop on his gf faces and she tricked him and ate it.

This comment about grief by u/GSnow to help someone cope with the sudden death of a friend. It helped me get through all kinds of grief over the last few years, from deaths to painful breakups. Really changed my life and how I handle these hard situations. An excerpt:

&#x200B;

>As for grief, you'll find it comes in  waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage  all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty  and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you  can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for  a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a  photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all  you can do is float. Stay alive.  
>  
>In  the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without  mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch  your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe  weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but  they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you  and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You  never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a  picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be  just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves,  there is life.  
>  
>Somewhere down the  line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are  only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come  further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or  Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most  part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that  somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet,  sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but  you'll come out.

I read this whenever I need a laugh. It has never let me down.
"Are you fucking sorry???"
I can't remember where this was posted but this woman had downloaded a sleep app that used audio recording in her sleep.

When she woke up and reviewed the recording, you can hear her talking in her sleep and she asks a question like "what are you doing?"

And all you hear is a bunch of muffled noise and a response which was like "go back to sleep" or something like that. 

OP was trying to help figure out if it was a home invasion or something else.

The entire recording is very creepy as is the situation involved. I wish I could remember where it was, but I think about it all the time and now I don't want to record my sleep.
Seeing all these comments makes me realize how much I missed
The post where a girl posted in AskReddit about what weird situations seemingly turn you on and described how she weirdly gets horny in her morning physics class. [Turns out one of her classmates saw the post and they both had that realization they were in the same class.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/msywj/what_is_the_most_mundane_thingsituation_that/)
The guy who was on his computer, wearing headphones, he thought he heard something so he took his headphones off, heard screaming and discovered his wife was being raped in the next room over, toddler daughter was present and being told she was next by the rapist. I think he said he could never wear headphones/ear buds or anything after that, and his wife never entered that house again. They bought a new house and
Moved shortly after. Really heartbreaking story for that whole family.
Late to the party here, but Best Comment Sequence has got to be /u/ForgettableUsername's incredible, deadpan response to [Frog in hailstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/v58pb/frog_in_hailstone/).

It was an ass credit that asked "what celebrity do you think is secretly gay?" First thing that popped into my head was Tom Cruise so I click to add my obviously superior answer to the post and my jaw just dropped. Every. Single. Answer. Was Tom Cruise. Every. Single. Answer. I lost my shit at that one. I just kept scrolling to the point that the words Tom and Cruise stopped making sense. It was a glorious day.
A couple years ago I saw an AMA by u/SierraBravo26 about being an air traffic controller. He said it was a six figure job that doesn’t require a college degree.

the one that has a friend who said "you like that, you fucking retard" as a dirty talk during sex.
I was there when Kevin first entered our lives.

"It's turtles all the way down"
*Not me, but an old friend of mine.
Really quiet, soft-spoken, polite guy. A total gentleman and a graduate student in the liberal arts. Also, pretty inexperienced, tentative, and vanilla sexually.
He's dating this really cool girl for maybe two months. She is much kinkier in bed. She floats the idea of dirty talk, and apparently likes to be objectified, even demeaned a bit, from time to time. He's hesitant, but wants to please her and doesn't dismiss the idea outright. Changes the subject and figures that they'll revisit the idea another time.
Anyway...they have sex a few days later for the first time since the conversation. Really going at it doggystyle, and she tells him to talk dirty to her. He says that he can't think of anything to say, so he says nothing, and she then repeats the request, but the second time she is not fucking requesting, but demanding it.
He comes up with: "Yeah...you like that, you fucking retard?"
He's never struck me as one for embellishment, so I believe him. He said that was it for sex that night, although they are still together two years on now.*

Recently recovered excerpt from Napoleon's Journal.

*"It was the 14th day of September, the year of 1812. We were outside the gates of Moscow. My soldiers who hadn't succumbed to the bitter frost of the Russian wasteland were constantly being cut down by remnants of Kutuzov's shattered army.*

*I yearned to return to Josephine, I yearned to return to my home. The Russians would not give in, they were too proud of a people.*

*Ney had left the field tent to rouse the vanguard, we were to finally enter the Bear's heart and vanquish it. As I reviewed our resupply plans once we took hold of the city, a strange man with a long beard and a fur coat entered the tent. My bodyguards were nowhere to be found, their sleepy minds betrayed them. Was this an assassin? Had Kutuzov somehow infiltrated my Grand Army?*

*He approached me with wide eyes. "Bro! You're that Bonaparte dude! Whats up my Corsican from another mother! Been waiting till your retreat from Moscow!"*

*Who was this? His French was bastardized, his accent was a noticeable strange English. He spoke of a retreat from Moscow? Impossible I thought, the Russian Empire would break today. He was insane and made no sense. He walked over to me with his hands up, showing that he held no weapons. But with a quick motion he sprung his leg and brought to bear the weight of his foot against my manlyhood. The pain shot through my body and left me on the ground, it was more painful than the injuries I sustained in the Italian alps.*

*He ran outside as I called the guards after him. We searched an hour trying to find him, Ney personally lead a squad but to no avail.*

*I sometimes question, as I sit here in this forgotten island on the edge of the world, if he existed at all. He may have been, perhaps, a figment of my imagination. My own intuition manifested in a dream-like form telling me to leave before it was too late, foretelling the pain of me losing France.*

*Whatever it was, it is lost to the Russian tundra. May it serve as a warning to any foolish conquerors who dare invade Russia in the winter. Do not ignore the Oracle of Moscow."*

This is the canonical explanation for the TP hoarders
Don't have sex with so-and-so because they have herpes
Sell all the stocks in February and buy Tesla calls in March.
Start a twitch/youtube channel that predicts 2020 accurately and have everyone think I'm Nostradamus.
I would go to the doctor in early January to check on my kidneys. Maybe we could save them.
idk, cry, invest, reset, repeat.
I'm gonna be real sad because I just spent the year losing a ton of weight, and I don't want to start over.
Get a haircut in February.
All of these saddening comments make me realise just how much I've taken this year and my life so far for granted. The saddest story I have for this year is losing my best dog friend I grew up with. Heart breaking yes, but nothing like some of the stories I've read on here. I hope losing my dog is the saddest story of 2020 I'll have to share, and hopefully the saddest for many many years to come. Wish u all the best fellow redditnerds x
I'd probably go to California and just tell a couple what gender their kid would be. I can't stop a pandemic but I can halt a wildfire.

Tell Nevada to start counting mail in ballots before the Election Day.
I'd sit my brother down, tell him how much I love him, and hug him till my arms give out. I'd tell him how much I miss when we were kids and spent every day together. He was my twin born two years late and I'd give up everything to see him again. I would beg him not to go out that night. I would schedule a camping trip and we'd have so much fun.

Spend much more time with my old kitty that passed away on January second and with my old doggo that passed away in September. And spoil them with their favorite treats and lots of fun toys. I miss them so much. This years been rough.
Well the cancer was probably already terminal so I’d just try to see my mom before all the flights were cancelled
There's an episode of Doctor Who called Turn Left, where the Doctor dies a few years before the year the episode is set, causing mayhem across the world because he couldn't stop calamities that crippled and would eventually end the world. The protagonist of the episode, the Doctor's current companion, goes back in time to the episode's divergent point and kills herself in an attempt to ensure that the Doctor lives and the timeline is corrected.

If I woke up on January 1st, 2020, I would aim to achieve Donna Noble's goal, preferably without dying, but hey. Why should one life stand in the way of, what, a million now? Two?
Show my husband just how much I love him and appreciate him. Hug him longer, kiss him harder, squeeze his warm hands, laugh with him, record his voice, take more pics of him and of us together, not sweat the small stuff, be silly with him, savour every meal he made me, stare into his eyes and marvel in their clarity and sparkle. Lay my head on his chest to hear his heartbeat everyday.

He died in May at age 31.

I'd give anything to wake up tomorrow and see his bright blue eyes.

EDIT: Oh my goodness, I wrote this at about 3am and then went to sleep, I had no idea it was cause this much attention. Thank you to everyone who has commented, sent me well wishes and love and thank you for all of the lovely awards. Not sure I deserve so much kindness but I sure as hell appreciate it. 

He left our house walking, talking and smiling back at me as he got in to the ambulance and less than 24 hours later I felt his heart stop under my hand. He was already sedated when I arrived at the hospital so im not even sure he knew I was there but I pray he did. No one deserves to think they are dying alone.

He was the light of my life, my best friend and I miss him more than even I can comprehend.

Don't sweat the small stuff, folks. In the end, it rarely ever matters.

Peace and love to you all
Tell my grandma not to travel and stay home. I lost her to COVID on Monday. Her death will always hurt due to how preventable it was and how long it’d been since I’ve seen her. I will always miss her.

backup 4.5 years of phd research data before an accidental wipe removed all of it back in february

&#x200B;

EDIT: wow, this blew up! thanks for the kind people giving awards...... i'm trying to respond to all the comments..... but one thing i'll just mention here

most of the data lost was work i published by then, so it would've been nice to keep the codes but losing them wasn't a major loss....... but one work was unpublished, thankfully it was recent so i was able to rewrite the code from memory and publish it 2 months ago.... so the damage was mostly controlled

thankfully, my professor is a very considerate person and didn't get pissed off as much as he could have....... and now i backup everything religiously, so lesson learned without significant lasting damage, thankfully

&#x200B;

2ND EDIT: since my comment confused people, i'll explain what happened........ IT needed to upgrade the pc's firmware, and asked me to back up everything before giving it to them, since they would wipe the hdd...... i copied everything to dropbox, and once it copied only the subfolders, for some reason gave the green tick mark that means copying was done, so i didn't double check and just gave it to them...... i realized what happened later on, and by then they wiped the PC and turned the bits, so it was unrecoverable....... since my fiasco, IT enacted the policy that they will always backup the hdd of any PC before wiping it
Buy TP, bleach, hand sanitizer, and masks. Don't spend money on the stupid stuff I spent it on last time. Sell stocks at the peak and start my company sooner.

Get in touch with my ob-gyn and tell him my son’s going to be born with a heart condition even though you wouldn’t be able to see anything on the scans at 10 weeks, 16 weeks, 20 weeks and 28 weeks. Get in touch with paediatric cardiologists and specialists and give them as much information as I can remember and hopefully do whatever I can to save his life. I’d eat right, rest more, take care of myself more. 

I’d still accept it if he passed, but at least it would make me feel like I had done everything I could.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind thoughts and words. I never expected my comment to get this much attention. It was just the first thing on my mind, and it’s a desire that’s so true of any parent who’s lost a child that I had to speak it. 

I just wanted to say that I do know I did what I could, but it’s so hard to ever step back and admit 
 “ok, I did everything I could”. As a parent, you just feel compelled to do anything you can, even against all human logic.
I'd tell my dad to go see his doctor. He got his cancer diagnosis in May. Might have had a better shot if they'd found it in January.

Edit: Thank you so much for your well wishes, kind words and shiny badges, friends! I'm sorry for not replying to everyone, but it's nearly 3am now and I'll head to bed.
My dad is the most stubborn optimist, and I'll just follow his lead. Thanks again, and I hope the kindness you've shown me tonight comes back to you.
Forewarn CPS of my old childhood best friend and have them check in on her constantly. 

We haven’t been friends/spoken in a few years. But she snapped and killed her 6 month old baby this last spring and I would love to spare everyone that pain.
JUST like Groundhog Day, eh?  Well, some very bad things will happen to some very bad people.  And if I get caught, who cares?  Just kill myself in jail like Epstein didn't and start over.
If I start visiting my brother more often in January. Maybhe he wouldnt OD in may

Tell my ex I don’t want to try again, quit my job and go back to school full-time.
Send in my application to immigrate to New Zealand.
I start wearing a mask even if the virus is just around and  invest in amazon
Invest as shit ton in zoom and Amazon, bet a bunch of money on the chiefs Beating the 49ers in the Super Bowl, bet a bunch of money on the Lakers winning the finals.
Hug my uncle again. Lost him 2 weeks ago to Covid in Wisconsin. Good guy all around.
I start making as many bets as possible like bet you 100 bucks this will happen
Invest in Zoom, heavily. Then I move to New Zealand.
Break up with my gf, sell my car, get rid of all my Bill's except phone, grab my camping backpack and head out to the appalachian trail.
I’d like to say I would go full action movie hero and try to convince the right people about the incoming virus. But honestly I’d go out every night and dance and party with my friends from Jan 1-March 17.
Stop my little brother from smoking the fentanyl that killed him.
I would start sewing masks Jan 1st.
As soon as I'm back from lockdown, my bf and I request our vacation for the same week, three months in advance (his workplace is terrible about granting vacation time).
I sign up for skill share, and each iteration take a different course.
Be ready for my dogs newly developed seizures, cut my boyfriend off from liquor BEFORE the pandemic, stock up on TP, travel, visit my family more, and prepare all my teaching lessons now that I know the disaster that awaits us... But in reality I would probably do nothing, procrastinate, and let everything turn to shit just like it had because I would be too depressed not to.

Invest in amazon stock & stay at my old job
Invest in N95 masks and hand sanitizer.

Move to Canada and buy Zoom and PPE stock.
Move to New Zealand
invest in stocks, and make bank off of sports bets
I have at least four lives to save.  
All else is secondary; save those four.  
Everything else pales by comparison.
Sit back, and enjoy Unus Annus with a clear conscience
Sit in the forest alone for most of it and learn about myself..
Save Kobe
NOT FUCK UP MY FRIENDSHIP AND BITE MY OPINIONATED TONGUE
I would make huge bets on what’s going to happen. I prepare for COVID to get really big. I buy as much hand sanitizer as possible. I then just wait it out until the end of the year, maybe buying large amounts of masks.
If that happens, I won’t lie. I will just shoot myself.
Relive Unus Annus
Tell my sister to stay at home August 29th. She was killed by someone who was driving that was high. 
Love ya Katie
I use my awesome new found powers for good. First, I look for criminals. I tell the world how and when they will die. I make it happen, even if it wouldn't. I soon decide to become the god of the new world.

But soon it turns out that there was a great detective on my tail. I try to kill him on live TV. It's a trick! He survives. His name is L. So begins our game.

This is as much as I could recall of Death Note.
I don’t give a shit get my grades up go back to playing cod
I tell myself that even though I’m going to have another miscarriage in a month, I just need to be able to hold on because I will be adopting my daughter in the summer and she is what is going to make my life beautiful.
Probably just re-budget and prioritize my money in preparation for quarantine. Stock up on stuff like masks, gloves, cleaning supplies, etc. I'm not going to horde that stuff, but I am just going to have enough around so I don't have to deal with the shortages in toilet paper and soap that's going to happen later on in the year. Also forgo shopping for new clothes and instead buy myself some workout equipment before they become insanely expensive. Lastly I'll probably use the money I saved up to go on a vacation for a Switch (I don't think they were all sold out in January yet?) and a new gaming PC as well.
My grandma died in February. I'd call her everyday
Overthrow the US government
Inform my family that my sister has pre-symptomatic COVID, get her hospitalized and isolated ASAP, advise the doctors which meds to try treating her with, and get media involved to show there’s community transmitted COVID in Washington State. Hopefully turn the tides of infections in my country by getting lockdown started sooner and save my sister from dying a horrible death. (For context, my sister was an early casualty from COVID. We didn’t know until after her passing and received a diagnosis weeks after the fact when doctors re-reviewed her lung scans and symptoms based on what we know now.)
I would go on vacation. I missed 2019 because my mother was ill (and then died) and we were short staffed at the office all year. 2020 was supposed to be the year, and I was making my plans when Covid hit.
Start working from home. Invest in Tesla and zoom.
Get to New Zealand as soon as possible.
Cancel my Quibi account.
Buy LOTS of put options.
Go visit my family, and tell my dad to go to the doctor. Maybe they would catch his cancer earlier and we would have more time with him... Also stock up on toilet paper and hang out with friends a ton.
My wife died January 20th so I get to see her again, at least for a bit!!
I'd make a bomb threat on Kobe's copter.

I'd visit my father. A lot. He died from Covid on May 2nd (today would've been his 65th Birthday). 

We were semi estranged. Cool...but not tight.
Drink heavily because I'm about to get laid off again
Spend every second of every day with my mother who died July 23rd of cancer.  :( 



Warn my cousin to quit her job where she caught covid and spread it to her family and caused my aunt to be on a ventilator with 15% chance of survival. 



P.s. she was on it for a month and a half, called the family for an end of life event, pulled through that, had to have a tracheotomy put in, was in induced coma for most of that time and then 2 weeks with a trach.  Yesterday they took her trach and feeding tube out. It looks like she is gonna pull through!!!
Tell my best friend to not go to Florida and ride a parachute (?) to celebrate her boyfriend's birthday. Cord snap and they fell 30ft. Her boyfriend died and she's been in a coma ever since. I can't even go see her because of covid. I wish I could be there for her.
Push for more poll workers in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona ...
Sell everything and move to New Zealand and never come back ever.
Tell my mom the virus is real and she needs to take it serious. Fly back home if she won’t listen. Make her wear the mask.
Tore my Achilles in August and just had surgery to repair it after re rupturing it. I’d stop running, start PT, and build strength so I don’t have to go through this. 

Also enjoy my time with friends and family. Be better at saving money for when I get laid off.
Everyone in the comments is like "buy tesla calls" and "stock up on toilet paper".

Next thing you know this is some kind of an alternate reality where not all of the same events take place... now you're stuck with $5000 worth of hand sanitizer and toilet paper.
Leave my toxic girlfriend. Not let politics destroy my happiness. Be present. Take care of my self better.
Kick myself for not knowing any lotto numbers or sport scores, then just invest I guess.
Spend every day that I can with my mom. She passed away in April. I miss her more than anything. Fuck cancer
I see a lot of the same posts and this will probably get lost. I found out recently that my husband has felt off about our marriage and after talking I can see what he means. I would spend the summer really investing in our marriage and putting more time into it. And if it keeps repeating I would hopefully have more and more time to invest in us. I don't know if it would change anything but I hope it would and it would really be the only thing worth investing in.
On May 25th I carry my healthy and 9 months pregnant wife to the hospital and have every test done so that I could be holding my son right now instead of visiting his grave tomorrow.
Kill myself. Ain't no salvaging this septic fire
Because of the butterfly effect, any thing or situation I could prepare for may never actually happen, so that’s a bummer. What would I do? Have an existential crisis because I’m stuck in a time loop.
Sorry if this ends up being long but its angered me for quite some time.

About ten years ago my mother at age 69 had a massive stroke. They didn't expect her to live let alone come out of it mostly alright. Which she did except for some vision loss in her left eye. (Not total, just peripheral.) So she can only see perfectly straight out of that eye.

So after about a year recovering from the stroke and the ensuing infection from the surgery that ended up being worse then the stroke itself she decides she wants to go get tested to see if she can retain her drivers license. (Required by law in my province of Canada).

My father was not well either as he had a long term terminal illness so I pack them both up in my truck and take them to the DMV. Me and my father happily assuming there is no fucking way in hell she will pass. 

Aside from her vision issues, the amazingly quick witted and swift woman I grew up with was VERY unsure of her self at all times and took forever to make the smallest decisions. It broke my heart and it didn't even occur to me to be scared that she would get her license back.

Well she did, passed with "Flying colors" the DMV guy said. As a SAR (Search and Rescue) tech, the idea of taking him up in the helicopter and throwing him out without a rope occurred to me.

1 week later, accident number one. T-boned a poor lady as she was coming out of the grocery store. Not much damage and no injuries thankfully. Mother still refused to admit she wasn't fit to drive.

Month later, accident 2. She panics on a multi-lane cross city road and ends up on the raised median and rips the entire exhaust system off her car. Still won't admit any issues.

At this point I'm amazed I didn't have ulcers. Shortly after accident 2 my father passed away. I did everything up to and including begging to get her to give up the license. She wouldn't do it and for the next few months I spent every day with a knot in my stomach until I spoke to her around 6pm every night once she was "home from running around" 

Then around 1pm I get a call from her cell phone, this phone I bought her that she mostly ignored except to charge it. I couldn't understand a word she said she was so upset on the phone. I managed to get her general location out of her and hopped in a car and more then exceeded the speed limit getting down there.

Upon arriving there are two ambulances, shoes in front of her car and its up on the curb.

She's sitting on the curb next to it bawling her eyes out and I'm terrified she's killed someone.

Turns out a man and his son were walking out of the soccer pitch next to the road, began to cross on the cross walk and she didn't see them.

She thankfully only struck the father and aside from being banged up he wasn't super seriously injured.

Because of my job I knew most of the police officers in the city so one of them offered to follow me back to her house so she could take me back down to get her car.

By the time I had done so and got back to her condo she had stopped crying. Threw me the extra set of keys to the car she had and told me to get rid of the car.

She even tried to get the DMV worker that passed her fired after that. She immediately realized she shouldn't of ever gotten it back. She was actually terrified that she had been driving like that.

Years later she still comments about how she never even saw the man and his son and how she could of killed one or both of them.

I have all the respect in the world for seniors. My mother was one of the first women CEO's in this province and was a hellcat in her day. I learned a lot from her. But I also learned to accept limitations.

If you are older reading this post. If you think for even a second that you could maybe not be the safest person to be on the road, talk to and listen to your loved ones.

Its horrible to give up that freedom, it would be more horrible for you to kill some innocent person because you are too proud to give it up.


**EDIT** Thanks for the gold mysterious stranger!
Here in Illinois my grandpa had to do it every year after 75
That's a great idea. I'm going to call my 68 year old congressman and ask him to support such legislation.

Edit: Most driving laws are passed by state legislators, who usually do drive themselves.
Old retired guy here....

74 years old to be precise.

I would accept such a test provided it was only to catch really age related diseases.  (Dementia, poor reflexes, etc.)

I live in a retirement community and most of the people who should not have a license have already given them up.  

The first day I was here I heard a conversation between two guys.

Guy One:  I just turned 88 and turned in my driver's license.

Guy Two: Why would you do that?

Guy One: I don't want to spend the rest of my life in jail.


I'm all for retesting people, however, I'm not sure what you mean by specialized. The requirements for good driving don't change with age so it should be the same test. 
Ideally, we'd all be retested every 10 years or so until we hit 60, then we're retested every 5 years. 

However, older folks are a huge voting bloc an it's unlikely this would ever pass. 
I send patients for driver's evaluations if their ability to navigate through my office is concerningly questionable. Unaware drivers are just as dangerous as impaired drivers. 
*Let me say this about that:*

The neighbor I love is 93 and still driving, when she's up to it. She can barely see the on/off switch on her vacuum cleaner.

Should she be driving?

I want her to maintain independence; but at the same time, I don't think it's safe for her or others. Yet the DMV doesn't require her to take a vision exam or a competency test.
Ugh please. My grandma is practically blind and went to take her driving vision test to renew her license. She failed, but the lady at the DMV felt bad so she had her take it again and gave her hints so she could pass it. So now my practically blind grandma is out on the roads still. 

It's for their safety as much as anyone else's. I'm so mad that the lady at the DMV was so irresponsible as to let her keep driving. 
All for it. When I was 14 my friend was coming to my house and he got killed by my next door neighbor who happened to be elderly. My friend was on his skateboard and he was just up the street from my house. From the position of his body and where elderly guy stopped his car I could see he made a super sharp left turn that killed him and ran over my other friend. The other friend survived and recovered from his injuries. But my other friend not so lucky. Oh and my grand dad has Alzheimer's and frequently forgets where he is, and I think he still has his license, though my grandma finally took his keys.

 
I'm an eye doc and I'd be all for it. You know how often I get berated or threatened by geriatrics when I strongly suggest that they quit driving because they no longer meet the legal requirements for driving?
People should have to retake the drivers test every 10 years if not 20. I've seen too many terrible drivers of all ages.
[deleted]
Can we make everyone take it? 

Seriously, I see more horrible drivers in the Commuting age bracket than in the Retired age bracket. 
My grandma rear ended a line of stopped cars on the highway at full speed, no brakes, with my 5 year old brother in the car because she thought she saw a deer on the side of the road. She's been in another, less serious wreck, and has come to a dead stop while on the highway because she forgot where she was going multiple times since then. My dad had to unplug her battery and tell her that her car doesn't work anymore so she would start asking for rides. 
I would love if they took age into account in someway, I'm not an expert on anything so I don't know how they would do it, so that families wouldn't have to be torn between treating their elders like a child or worrying if they're going to get a call from the hospital any time they're behind the wheel. 
My fiancee's brother was killed riding his motorcycle  Sunday by a 91 year old who pulled out in front of him. He left behind a wife and 3 children. He was the one of the best guys I ever met. We are all devastated and it could have been prevented. That man had no business behind the wheel.
I'd be OK with it *if* over-70 drivers are statistically more likely to get into accidents.
I live in a town that caters to older people, and watching them drive is painful. By them, I mean end of middle age and up. From going 30kmph in a 70kmph zone, to watching them stare out the side window while going through that same zone. They swerve from side to side. I refuse to go anywhere with my grandpa driving, as he is now a horrible driver and has nearly crashed the car multiple times, then blames it on other drivers. 

However, I won't say that only elderly people need to be tested. I would hate having to do so, but we ALL should be tested. Just last night teenagers drove over a schools fence in a large truck. People saw them, cops haven't caught them. Younger people speed more, usually 70 in a 50. 

In just today, I got stuck behind someone doing 20kmph in a 50 zone, and then while I was going 60kmph someone flew past me like I was standing still. The roads would be better if we were all retested, and in regards to my town, if cops would actually do their job. Going severely under the speed limit is dangerous just as speeding is. 

We need statistics to show us which demographics cause the most accidents over distance driven.  If the over-70 leads in this, then yes. 
As an insurance professional: JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN DOING SOMETHING FOR A LONG TIME, DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE GOOD AT IT. Drivers should be tested every 5 years, not just once you hit a certain age.
Everyone should take a standardized road test every 5 years.
I'm for it. The inability for old people to drive would result in them voting en mass for public transportation improvements
By the time the law was passed, self driving cars will be available.
Or how about you just have to do a refresher course every ten years? There are a lot of people out there with fully functional senses that still need a reminder about the rules of the road. 
I'd be all for it if we can compensate them by providing transportation to those who can no longer drive for low cost. Self driving cars may soon fit this position.
They should make everyone take drivers ed classes every 10 years. Its ridiculous to think someone who passed drivers ed even 20 years ago knows all the new traffic laws and car technology.
Ontario has testing every two years for 80+. 70 is a bit young for that, honestly.

Edit: I'm surprised at how vehemently everyone disagrees with me that 70 is a bit young.  It may be true that I just happen to know a lot of abnormally strong and healthy older people, but most of the 70+ I know in no way fit the sickly, doddering image I think a lot of us have of the elderly.  Just like the majority of 20 and under don't fit the irresponsible, reckless image a lot of people have of kids.

According to these (admittedly old) [stats](http://www.allcountries.org/uscensus/1045_age_of_driver_and_number_in.html), the vast majority of traffic fatalities are caused by younger people.  A better solution is to test everyone every few years, and have stricter medical conditions, for everyone.
This has been tried, but the organizations like AARP are very powerful and shoot down this type of legislation.
It's hard enough to book a driving test these days. It takes a good 4 months in the UK.

This would worsen the situation. 
Based on the state of driving I see every day, everyone should have to pass a driver's test every five years. 
It won't happen. I'm assuming you're talking about the US. The DMV is a state level agency not federal, so if one state were to have that law another state may not have it. 
70 seems a little young these days.  I have a neighbor that I fish with at least once a week.  He drives his truck, towing a bass boat, without issue and he's 71 or maybe 72.  Of course maybe he's the exception. But I can see a test for people of a certain age, I'm just not sure what age I'd make the law.  Maybe 75?  My chick's 86 year old grandmother drives but she keeps it to day time hours during clear weather and stays within about a 5 mile radius in our small town.  Grocery store, pharmacy, post office, doctor appointments/vet visits, etc...  She's not had an accident but I could understand a driving test for her.  Really though, her understanding her limitations keeps things safe for her and others. It's such an individual scenario but I guess we'd have to draw a line somewhere. 
Over 70? My aunt started getting dementia at 58 and should have had her license taken then and there. Test us every ten years or with referral from a doc.  
Perhaps this would be best applied to the overall population.
Re-test with license renewal every 10-20 years by default, IMO. 
[deleted]
Imo driving tests in the us need to be more difficult and have the driver face most every scenario with at least 2 versions of each.

In addition this should have to be renewed every like 5 or 10 years with your DL.

Im a fire engine driver in OC/LA in CA and there are too many drivers (garden grove and dtla) that dont know to pull over and just stop, or try and make their turn before we "catch up".

Car accidents are the leading fatality for a reason. Secret to old life like japan? Better driving habits and rules
My father-in-law had some muscular degeneration for a few years before he passed away. He couldn't physically lift his feet to walk, and sitting wasn't much better. He ran a stop sign, and almost hit another car and a pedestrian with my wife in the car because he couldn't move his foot from the gas to the brake fast enough. She took his license out of his wallet and threw it in the fire when they got home. He was pissed for a long time, because in his head he was perfectly able to drive, and didn't even recall his near accident. Who knows how often that actually happened when we weren't around?
I'd rather see mass adoption of autonomous vehicles that would give the elderly the freedom of transportation without the need for driving. I believe they would self-police themselves to autonomous vehicles over driving themselves.
In my experience it seems like everyone needs a refresher after, let's say 10 years. One reason is traffic laws change w/o our knowledge except for maybe an article on page 6 of the paper. For example, I just learned that in PA they passed a law in June 2016 that allows drivers to go through a Red light that isn't changing.

Also it seems that everyone thinks that turn signals and speed limits are optional and the left lane is for going the same speed as every one else. 
Why is this so highly upvoted... 
I want everyone to retest every 5 years, period, and I want the test to actually be both relevant to real driving and failable if you suck.
If you don't want to die:

Drink every time someone admits they were wrong.
One shot for every "No one is above the law"
If you still have a witches hat laying around from Halloween, you can have a person wear it. It'll rotate around the room on time or whenever a new person is introduced during proceedings. Whenever the term witch Hunt is used you all scream burn the witch and the person in the hat takes a shot of fireball
Most of these suggestions are jokes about drinking continuously but if you want a drinking game that’s really about the fundamental impact of the hearings: 

1. Every time a witness suddenly realizes “oh no, I shouldn’t have said that.”

2. Every time a GOP questioner suddenly realizes “oh no, I shouldn’t have asked that.”

3. Every time a carefully crafted narrative falls apart and the witness is redirected into explaining a contradiction between their testimony and; 

(a) previous statements,        
(b) previous testimony,       
(c) written evidence.
When it goes to the senate I’m going to tape a cherry tomato to my TV and see how many times McConnell’s mouth goes near it.
Hello all you Youtube channels and clickbait "news" websites shamelessly stealing the responses from this and claiming them as your own. I see you.
Drink every time someone doesn't answer the question
I don't recall = drink.
A shot of peach shnapps (which is beyond gross, IMHO) every time you hear the word "impeach"

A shot of Jaeger every time you hear the word "Tremendous"
International Drinking Rules :

Every time a county is name checked in the impeachment hearing, you must drink a shot of the most famous national drink..... 

Russia - Vodka 

Ukraine - Horlika 

China - Baijiu

USA - Bourbon
Rules? If there's anything we should have learned in the last few years, it's that there are no rules. Drink whenever, and then try to dodge the consequences the day after.
Rule 1: Drink heavily to dull the pain.

Rule 2: There is no rule 2.
Take a drink every time Russia is mentioned.
There’s gonna be a lot of people needing liver transplants after this week...
Drink every time PBS is threatened with defunding
If we turn the impeachment hearings into a drinking game, we better have a death count on the screen to, to count how many people got alcohol poisoning from playing the drinking game
Take a shot every time you hear quid pro quo and try not to die.
Every time Gym Jordan doesn't have on a jacket...drink.
Take a shot every time one of the following is mentioned:

* Fake News
* Witch Hunt
* Civil War

Take a shot every time someone:

* Makes a question irrelevant to the proceedings to try and confuse the issue
* Brings up whataboutism
* dodges the question instead of answering it
* blames the other party
* blames someone else not party affiliated
* blames someone else within their party
* returns a question with an insult instead of an answer

I figure you'll be unconscious within fifteen minutes to a half an hour, depending on your tolerance.
Take a shot whenever Putin is mentioned.
Take a drink every time you catch a [rhetorical fallacy](http://www.mvrhs.org/englishdept/shark/links/General%20Information/Rhetorical%20Fallacies%20U.%20Texas%20@%20Austin.pdf) of any kind (2-page PDF warning)
The moment anyone says anything, remain stone cold sober watching every last second and remembering how we wound up in this situation.
Scroll on Twitter under the Hashtag at the same time and drink everytime someone mentions they would start a civil war if Trump is impeached
Open bottle, drink until empty. Repeat. 

You will need it.
I've been playing this drinking game since 2016. I'm not sure how much my liver can take.   
Edit-joke's on me, apparently imma champ...cheers!
Take a shot for every person you register to vote for the 2020 elections #democracy
Take a shot for...

- Hillary's emails
- Hunter Biden
- If anyone says MAGA in its abbreviated or full form
- Do nothing Democrats
- A trump tweet containing the phrase "Witch Hunt" with at least one spelling error in the tweet
- Perfect Phone Call


Finish your drink for...

- Trump promoting an anti Hillary video on twitter
- Any mention of cofveve
- A red herring involving MS13
- Any mention of Xi or Putin by a Republican

Power hour starts with... 

- Ivanka promoting her brand or getting new chinese patents

- Absolutely any mention of Baron by a member of the trump family

- Trump saying the words "Fuck" or "Shit" on live TV.

Edit: Holy wah, thanks for the plat. Now i feel like I have to actually do this.
Take a drink anytime:

1)A republican complains about the process being unfair

2) A republican questions the motives of a witness

3) A republican mentions Hillary, Biden or Obama

4) A democrat mentions Russia, Ukraine or the Mueller Report

5) Anyone utters the words "quid pro quo"

6) A republican declares the process a waste of time.

Shoot a whole bottle of jack if:

1)A republican admits that Donald Trump did something wrong

2) A democrat says the process is a waste of time.


Have fun and may you not get alcohol poisoning.
[deleted]
Maybe take a drink every time someone answers a question honestly the first time it's asked? You know, like, if you have to drive afterward or something.
Can someone give me a run down on what’s happening? I’m completely fucking stupid and I live under a rock.
Everytime a felony is added to the list take a drink.

I'm assuming he's going to live tweet. So everytime he angrily responds to an accusation take a drink.

If his tweet mentions "witch hunt" or insults the Democrats take two drinks.

If he specifically calls out Nancy Pelosi or AOC take three drinks.

Everytime a Congress person asks a stupid question take a drink.

Everytime Republicans conveniently move their criteria for impeachment take small a sip (they are going to be doing this a lot. You don't want to get alchohol poisoning)
One if by land two if by sea
TRUMP-2-DRUNK DRINKING GAME

Player(s): 1 to Infinite

Age: 18/21 (depending on legality in your region)

Timeframe: As long as you can hold a beverage in your hand, because this might take awhile

Rules: Every player sits in front of the TV, with a beverage in hand (you should choose a good session beverage, this is going to get you proper fucked). As the impeachment process is progressing, players should be listening for the various chugging rules. When a rule is violated, each player must take a sip from their respective beverage. Don't rush this, honestly - be smart.

Chug Rules

* When someone says "Quid Pro Quo", raise your drink and salute, then chug

* When someone calls the whistleblower a liar/traitor, make a pirate arrrgh and sip

* When anyone uses a whataboutism, stand up, spin around 360, and consume

* If anyone mentions "fake news", smack your forehead and say "duh", then imbibe

* If anyone mentions Giuliani, take the little green man off your glass, then take a glug

* Put your thumb on the table anytime someone says "witch hunt:, and the last person to do so takes one

* Whenever Pelosi is mentioned, the first person to "Pelosi clap" can give a drink to another player

* If someone says "Trump has done nothing illegal", everyone make a siren sound and guzzel
Shot every time the narrative changes between "There was no quid pro quo" and "There was quid pro quo but that's fine."
Every time someone refuses to answer a direct question ( whether through dancing around it or saying they can’t recall, or can’t answer etc ) chug for 3 seconds. Hopefully this helps you get through one person without dying for alcohol poisoning 

Or

Every time someone says Trump - take a shot
Just drink constantly.  Don't stop drinking until this whole goddamn thing is over and we can get back to the real reality we split off from in 2012.
Promise to give up drinking if Trump gets impeached.
1 drink: every time the same Trump or Biden is mentioned

2 drinks: every time Ukraine is mentioned

3 drinks: every time “impeach” or “impeachment” is said 

Finish your drink: every time someone takes one of those awkward gulps of water
Please don't do this. You'll all die of alcohol poisoning no matter what the rules are.
Nice try, funeral companies
every time you want the world to end Drink a bottle of Whiskey
Watch it with someone from the other side of the fence, and each of you drinks every time the other says something you think is obviously dumb. You'll both be hammered in minutes.
We all just tweet 'Sad' After we finish a bottle
How about every time a Congressman (or woman) asks a question and then interrupts the person trying to answer it, we hit ourselves in the side of the head with a hammer?
I like beer. I drank beer, I still drink beer. I like beer. Do you like beer, Senator?
The past three years has already done enough damage to my liver - I'm going to put together impeachment bingo cards instead.
I assume that every rule-set degenerates to, "drink non-stop until drinking more is no longer possible." Whether that is because you have run out of digestive space, are too drunk to successfully consume additional liquor, or are dead will depend on the individual.
Drink every time you hear "Clinton"
Take a drink everytime someone answers a question with "I don't remember."

Happy New Year.
I agree that there should be different tags for porn and gore. Sometimes a person is chill with porn but hates gore, or even vice versa. Ive often clicked on posts tagged nsfw on subs like r/tifu or r/confessions thinking it would be a funny story, and then I get bombed with a story about gore or even a photo a couple of times. It'd be nice to be able to avoid those.
I've subed to so many subs that have the word 'porn' in it that - apparently - my profile has been flagged nsfw.

Power washing porn, sky porn, earth porn, food porn, etc etc. Zero sex porn.

So. Yes. Add levels of nsfw. I'd like to not be banned on various subs just because of my  viewing preferences.


Edit: I'm sooooo sorry if you've been flagged for posting on my comment here.

How was I suppose to know it was going to explode like this! Perhaps this is the time we bring this to the attention of whoever can fix it? Clearly it's a popular topic.
...I swear I've seen a NSFL tag on reddit before
I would like it personally.  Lots of things are marked NSFW when it's not really like this post for example.  But along with that comes porn which I don't really mind but it also comes with NSFL stuff which I do mind very much.

Spent a good few years looking at some gore shit and it's definitely colored my view on humanity in general.  I saw the fucking nipple-belt post about that serial killer on that Thanks I Hate It sub and it just fucking turned my stomach and ruined my mood.  It's not a big deal but I'm really trying to preserve my mood these days.
Yes. Sometimes gore-ish stuff gets onto front page, like the pics showing the beheading of the French teacher.

I would have appreciated a warning...and didn't really was interested seeing something like this.  


/dms exploding with dozens of guys asking for links. I don't have one and fuck you all
That would be nice because I like boobs, but not from the inside angle.
[deleted]
Very useful. If guts and gore pop up, it's no big deal. But I work at a school. Any sort of porn is like, instant fired.
PLEASE, for the love of all that is good and SFW.   
Porn is A-OK by me, but I have a hardline panic trigger for gore. NSFL tags are amazing.
But what if it's both
Yes I would appreciate this. Also we n ed a "spider" flair.
it would be very useful because i want to see tiddy not a bloody 12 car gang beat up
Yes, definitely. I'd block NSFL stuff entirely. I don't care about seeing naked people, but it really bothers me seeing dead/dying/very injured people.
I would like an animal cruelty flair
I'm a veteran; I love me some NSFW but I hate NSFL. Myself and lot of others in similar shoes would benefit from two separate flairs.
Very useful, it would had prevent me from seeing the beheaded photo of that french teacher a couple weeks ago. Thanks
As a guy who unintentionally saw a leg blackened and eaten down to bone by gangrene, yes I think it would be very useful.
If we had another AskReddit post asking this same fucking question again tomorrow and the next day, so you think it would be useful?  Mods this post has hit front page a hundred times, how are you not on top of this?
I thought NSFL was Not Safe for Florida when I read this
Additionally things that actually aren’t nsfw shouldn’t be labeled as such. So like clicking on a blurred out nsfw picture labeled “Wife shows off hot pussy” and it’s a picture of dudes wife at the beach with their cat, like, please stop that.
I just wish people would tag posts and videos especially about rape, violence and such nsfw :< way too many times ive cried or almost had a panic attack because i read or saw something. I try to be careful about the subreddits im subbed to but its not faultproof.
Yeah I hate when I’m trying to jack off and then some naked chick comes up on my screen
I really don't understand why some people are fascinated by gore.

"Here's a video of a teenage girl getting killed by a cartel gang with her face being peeled off"

Why would you think for a second that I'd like to see that? Fuck off with that shit
Nice try, market research firm.
Yes , id much rather look at someone's ass instead of the rotting carcass of a 12 day old deer
People don't know how to use the search function.  
Chaos would ensue.
Yes, but if there's a global setting to turn off NSFL entirely. I know I'd use that setting.
Simple. Sex is life, gore is death.  Sex  and nudity ruins only my job, gore ruins my mood, my life, etc.

I would almost never click NSFL but NSFW would probably always make me curious. I am all for it. I just don't like violence at all.
A wonderful idea but sadly people seem incapable of using or seeing the  NSFW flair as it is now.
Very useful.

**PLEASE DO, REDDIT**
Yes

Good
Yes, not everyone wants their day ruined by death and gore. If we had the choice to click for porn or gore you'd see a big difference in numbers.
Also filter by spoiler tag
Absolutely. I am actively interested in gorey/ NSFL content, unless there's animals involved, and at the same time experience strong discomfort when faced with unexpected sexual content or sexualized nudity.

To me these two things should definitely be separated, because if I already feel annoyed and uncomfortable, I can only imagine what it's like for people the opposite way - expecting a nice pair of tits and being faced with a close-up of some teen who's blown their brains out. That's gotta kill the mood (if it doesn't, please talk to soneone you trust).

This ain't the first time this feature has been asked for/ proposed, and I really wonder why reddit hasn't picked up on it yet. I suppose it would also make the hunt for undesired content easier
Add it and only activate it in november so that people don't lose NNN
What about those naughty posts over at r/chairsunderwater?
Yes! So useful. Cause I don’t mind porn/nsfw sexual esque stuff but as a person with PTSD I can’t handle gore/violence and I would LOVE that distinction. Also, as a person with trypophobia, we could use NSFL for that too.
Wait, it’s not already?
This is such a softball question lmaoo yes I want to know if I’m about to see boobies or some dude get his brains blown out
I dont ask much from this site, but i would really like that as a change!
yes, it would be fucking useful

a fat tiddied ainme milf is differnt to a dead fucking dog
I would prefer this, as I’m into surgery pictures, but I don’t want porn in my newsfeed
Kinda tired of having to constantly filter out porn when I come across it.  Too many things are tagged NSFW, that I don't want to block all NSFW, but I just don't want the front page of reddit to have tits and blowjobs on it constantly.  

Look, we all know where to find porn if we want it, I just don't want to have it everywhere.

Edit:  I have a rather large list of blocked porn subs I use RES to filter out when I come across them.  It's gotten down to a manageable level, although, new ones still rotate through regularly.  I'm not going to post them here, since it will inevitably offend one or more people "from" those subs, who will retaliate by falsely flag the post for brigading, or whatever, so PM and I'll respond with the list.
For those who like boobs but not beheadings
Thank God I can now filter my gore from my porn 🥰🙌
Once Reddit does this they confirm that they are a porn site.
See I like to live on the edge. It’s almost a game. Titties, or a guy who got his arm mangled in an industrial shredder?
Doesn’t matter,I jack off either way
Yes because titties are nice and violence is horrifying

Titties nourish and bring joy and provide life ☺️

Violence and gore are traumatic and unnecessary 😤
I'm uneducated. I know the W stands for work, what does the L stand for?
I don't see why not plus it'll be easier to filter. the only problem I can see happening is that it will encourage some really fucked-up posts
Definitely. Gore doesnt bother me in fictional context but knowing its real unsettles me and tends to fuck me up for hours after. I rarely see it on accident here but it has happened and i'd like if it didnt
What does NSFL stand for
i mean it'd obviously be useful and i always see full support for it every time this comes up, but reddit just won't implement this. you can find threads going years back about this.

Usually people say it's because reddit doesn't want to acknowledge that that content is on their site for ad reasons.  


The solution is that ANY sub that allows gore/injury related stuff SHOULD have a tag for it that's heavily enforced. I've left several subs because a blurred image turned out to be something horrible.
Yes, i could filter out porn, which makes my wife mad, and still see gore/violence. Also, stop locking posts.
Would be great for nnn
I wish there was a flair/warning for gore & stuff...! It's not something I want to see, and it's quite awful especially when it catches you off guard. I'm also sometimes scared to open NSFW-tagges posts because of it. I would definitely appreciate such a flair!
What does nsfl mean?
The week after I got married someone posted a photo of a guy who had gotten his wedding ring caught in a fence while climbing it. As he fell it removed the skin off his finger... that shit scarred me, and is totally NSFL.
Would it be based on their actual stance, or what they claim is their stance?
They'd lie even more (to get elected) than they do now.
You should look up the philosophical thought experiment called the Veil of Ignorance. It poses a similar question: You have to look at all political, economic, and social ideas without knowing what your socioeconomic position is.

E: Pasting the reply from u/ucantharmagoodwoman to give a more accurate description of the experiment, popularly attributed to American philosopher John Rawls.

You have to look at all that and then design a society that you would want to live in. But, the catch is, *you don't know what your position will be.* You might be at the bottom, you might be at the top. The idea is that you'll try to make the society as equitable as possible. (Kind of like the kid who cuts the cake doesn't get to pick his slice.)
I don't think it would work. It's very easy for a politician to take a verbal stance on an issue - it's different to see their actual history and actions. Politicians would just sound as vague and non-committal as possible, which they usually already do, and we wouldn't be able to hold them accountable if they were being dishonest about their actual platforms and beliefs. It would just cause more problems, if anything.

edit: wow this blew up! [please don't vote for Michael Bloomberg in the primaries](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/bloomberg-avoiding-scrutiny-stop-frisk)
It should be like the blind auditions on the voice!
The best bullshitter wins, not that that changes much, but without anything to hold them accountable to their statements and commitments its just a mess.

How would you feel if r/askreddit banned leading questions that begin with “how would you feel”?
[deleted]
I mean for one, it isnt plausible. But also the ability to be social is important for a leader.
I think we need to know more than just the policies. I want to know if they're just saying things for votes or if there's proof of them actually trying to do what they say.

 It's all very well saying war is bad, but are you actually protesting against wars, or just saying it's bad (as an example).
[deleted]
Interesting in theory, but context - in the form of values or motivations - matters.

For a very extreme example you can go to r/PoliticalCompassMemes/ and see that two people in a vacuum oppose chattel slavery from Africa, but one of them opposes it because the institution itself is wrong (LibLeft) and the other because they don't want black people in America (AuthRight).

If you are curious, you could try one of the online tests that does essentially what you're asking. I usually do [ISidewith](https://www.isidewith.com/).
No, because things like leadership ability and integrity matter.
Lmao at all the supportive comments. It’s really one of the dumbest idea I’ve ever read about elections. 

You realize a person can lie about their stance right? Okay so now you have 400 candidates who all say their stance is whatever is highest polling, or a slight variation thereof. Some might be true believers in those reforms but most just take those positions cynically to get elected. How can you tell who’s who?
Anyone can fake a "stance".
You need all of it to know if you are being lied to or not... and even then most people can't tell the difference.
Strongly dislike this idea. I view character and integrity as equally important to policy positions and without knowing anything else about the candidate, I cant evaluate these traits
I'd be happy if the early primaries simply involved a basic civics contests and the person who scores the lowest is automatically disqualified from running.
No way that’s an awful idea. You need accountability and resumes.
Whoops voted for hitler
Dumb
We would be governed by AI
In the UK during the time of the recent general election there was a site sort of like this principle that gave you the initiative to vote based upon policy rather than party. It was basically just a question on a certain issue such as climate change and then would show various options for solutions/ideas and by the end would show you the party who’s policy’s you sided with the most. A good idea in my opinion as many simply write off their preferred parties ‘rival’ without looking at the possible positives of their ideas and could also help those who are disengaged from politics due to the drama of it all to actually see the facts and see what they side with the most.
trump would have won even harder. the only reason why some of his party dose not like him is because he's a dick. if this fact was hidden from them, all any one would see is 'lower taxes, and increase border security.'  those are both things that are very popular in america.
You can do this right now; go to [isidewith.com](http://isidewith.com), fill out the form, and it'll tell you which candidates match your views the best.

I think we'd all be better off if people just did that.

Well considering 2020 has had something crazy happen almost every month, this is what I'd propose:

Jan) rather than crazy bush fires in Australia, they invent an effective eradication method for Covid-19. 99% effective that basically reduces it to a cold, it's released to the world and enables all countries to stabilize.


Feb-Mar) unprecedented global free trade deals between most major powers, enabling nearly every country to financially recover and begin to prosper after 2020


Apr-may) the top 10% wealthiest people in the world decide to donate 10% of their funds back to society as a thank you to the world. This should effectively raise the socio-economic state of the bottom 50% of people. Increasing overall spending and helping small businesses around the world recover.


June-July) Peace in the middle East. The people of the middle eastern countries, fed up with their quality if life, finally get peace. Rebuilding of many destroyed city's and towns, a major upgrade to infrastructure in the areas.

Aug-Oct) cure for some forms of cancer is finally achieved. Mass rollout across the world, breakthroughs in other cancer treatments.


Nov-Dec) contact with our first Alien race, peaceful negotiations begin along with the trade of information and technology. A new age of enlightenment begins.



-edit- just wanted to thank everyone for the up votes and awards. 
Also: it amuses me to no end that a post that ends with first contact with aliens and a new age of enlightenment has so much controversy over the redistribution of 10% of wealth.

We also agree to not worship money or stupid people ever again.

Cybernetics. We all get bionic eyes, spines, and limbs.

Physics. We can turn ambient heat into electricity, simultaneously solving the energy crisis and climate change (in fact we gotta use some of that free energy to warm things back up!)

Medicine. Cancer is cured and there's too many out of work oncologists.

Economics. We all realize that nobody actually needs to do most of the work we're all pretending to do, so we let the robots do it for us. Almost nobody works anymore, since universal basic income is more than enough to live well. 

Astronomy. Life on Venus. Life on Mars. Life on Europa. Life on the *friggin' moon*. Even life in the space vacuum between planets. Now that we know how to look, it turns out life is everywhere! Since energy is so cheap now and everyone is rich, it's trivial to design hundreds of missions to send thousands of people to explore all the cool stuff we find in the solar system.

I make a company that pulls my family out of poor middle-class
My dad finishes chemo and makes a full recovery
I am a police officer in a medium sized suburban town in Texas. I have been in law enforcement for 14 years. I love my job, I love how I get to help people and I love how I get to cause positive changes in peoples' lives. I love how 99.9% of the time, my badge is shiny...today my badge is not shiny.

I am tired of hearing the excuses given by other people for a police officer's misconduct. I am tired of excuses being made for people who tarnish my badge. I am so tired of hearing how officers have a stressful job and their misconduct was a result of that stress. You know who else is under stress? The people who called us, that person whose loved one just committed suicide, the family who called us because they found grandma dead and now we're asking everyone questions, the 7-11 clerk who just had a gun shoved in his face, and even the guy we just put in handcuffs and told him he is losing his freedom. Sorry, but our stress is low compared to these folks. We might have to go into these situations, but we get to leave them and pretend none of that shit ever happened after our shift is over.

I am tired of hearing excuses for the bad police officers, I am tired of the excuse "well, he puts his life in danger". Sure, I know we put our lives in danger, I've had guns, knives and even swords pulled on me. I've responded to bomb threats, suicidal subjects, assaults in progress, robberies in progress, etc. You know who else puts their lives in danger? Fire fighters, deep sea fisherman, loggers, people who step foot outside their homes in Chicago. We are trained to deal with danger, we are provided with equipment and training to help us survive those dangers. Do I face an increased risk of not going home? Sure, but that's why I am at an increased level of awareness at work, so I can respond to threats appropriately without panic and over responding.

I am tired of hearing about the thin blue line. I believe in the thin blue line, I believe in looking out for my fellow officers. I don't believe in hiding the misconduct or unlawfulness of other officers, and I have always spoken up. What many forget, standing behind the thin blue line doesn't mean concealing the misconduct of other officers, it means confronting those officers so they don't do something to ruin their lives, the lives of others, or violate the law or code of conduct. It means walking up to the officer with his knee on a suspect's neck and saying "dude, this is too much, stop", before the officer commits murder. It means walking up to the officer who has been drinking all night and saying "dude, I'll give you a ride home". Instead of hiding misconduct, prevent it, help your fellow officer not do something to ruin his life or another's life. If you do see misconduct, address it, take it to the appropriate level, stop tarnishing my badge. We took an oath to uphold the law, uphold our ethics and protect our communities, sometimes that means arresting other police officers or holding them accountable for policy/ethics violations.

This officer violated the rights of George Floyd and murdered him through his actions. The officers who were on scene and failed to act are just as responsible. There are multiple videos of this incident and there is no real question as to what happened.

For those folks who wonder what makes it murder or manslaughter. Murder is the act of causing death to another human being through an action which a reasonable person would know (or intend) could result in the death of the victim. Manslaughter is the act of causing death through an act which is reckless in nature.

Every officer in America is taught about positional asphyxiation and while some departments allow neck restraints, all officers are taught the dangers of neck restraints and are taught not to apply pressure to the back of someone's neck or head when they are proned out on the ground in handcuffs.

Floyd was handcuffed with little resistance and they were able to walk him across the street to a patrol unit. Floyd can be seen in a surveillance video falling to the ground next to the unit on the sidewalk side of the unit. Cell phone footage then shows the officer on top of Floyd's neck on the opposite side of the unit, the street side. There is a random man in the background telling Floyd just to get in the car and he can't win. Floyd can be heard saying he knows and he's done. This implies that Floyd may have resisted or attempted to escape, but was still restrained in the handcuffs. Floyd can be heard multiple times saying he can't breathe. The cell phone video shows the officer kneeling on top of Floyd's neck for at least eight minutes, with around four of those minutes with Floyd being unconscious.

Even if Floyd did attempt to resist or escape, there was no reason to hold him down for eight minutes. What was the point of restraining him for so long? Why did the other officer not assist the primary officer with restraining Floyd so they could get him in the patrol unit quicker? Why did the primary officer continue to restrain Floyd by his neck after Floyd became unresponsive? Why can the officer be heard at some point asking Floyd if he is still a tough guy? I can only come up with one answer to all of these questions, and that was the primary officer, Chauvin, wanted to prove to Floyd that Floyd was not such a tough guy. I see an officer assaulting another human being, going beyond taking control of a suspect, using force as punishment and ultimately causing the death of another human being. I see a second officer who stood and watched and did nothing, despite knowing that what the first officer was doing was a violation of law and policy. I see officers who were trying to get back at Floyd for running his mouth and resisting an arrest by using force they KNEW could result in death or serious bodily injury in a situation which did not justify using deadly force.

This officer committed murder, plain and simple. This officer tarnished my badge and the badges of all police officers. Worst of all, this officer tortured his victim for eight minutes, imagine your last thoughts and memories being those of a police officer, a person who the public is supposed to be able to trust, placing his body weight on your neck, slowly asphyxiating you against hot asphalt while he asks you if you're still a tough guy. I hope this officer, and any officer who allowed this to happen, is tried and convicted. It's going to be some time before I can polish my badge back to a shine, in the mean time, a family is suffering, a community is burning, all because of one guy who should have never been an officer.

What do I think? I think assholes like this make my job that much harder and damage the trust I work so hard for. I think assholes like this ruin peoples' lives and ruin families. I think assholes like these should be stuck in a prison with all of the people they ever arrested.

For all the police officers here what would the charges be if one of the bystanders pulled the police officer off of the poor guy?

Wow thanks for gold!
I'm a former police officer, and so have had plenty of training in physical restraint of individuals being arrested.  

There is no police academy training officers to kneel on someone's neck to subdue them, That's how you kill a person. 

 There is extensive training on how to avoid seriously injuring a person while restraining them, and I guarantee you every one of these officers was trained to never strike a person in the neck or choke them.

The officer who killed him is very clearly liable for manslaughter at the very least, and I think the other officers who stood by have some accountability as well because they knew damn well that was not how you handle a person, and should have stepped up.
Absolutely sick to my stomach. 

I'm a lieutenant in my home town police department. I started my day by showing the video to my officers and making sure my people understood that this is murder, plain and simple. You never, outside of a life and death struggle, do anything like this. 

George Floyd was handcuffed and on the ground. If he was still struggling badly enough that they felt a need to hold him down, there's a hundred ways to do it safely. Use of force should always be as measured and considered as possible. There will always be times where an officer sees danger and has to make a split second decision without the luxury of weighing the consequences. That clearly was not the case here. He had all the time in the world to think about what he was doing. He had multiple people there telling him to stop. And none of his fellow officers intervened. All of that is why I find this incident particularly disgusting. They had so many chances to do the right thing. 

Luckily, I have the fortune of working with good people who see this shit for what it is. Before the video was over, before I told them that George Floyd died because of this, my officers were muttering things like, "What the fuck is he doing?" "You can't do that shit" and "He needs to get off the man's fucking neck!" Made me way prouder to be their leader than any number of arrests they could make to see that their instincts were not to defend the officer. 

For what it's worth, I'm glad that they were fired. I've heard mention in this thread that one of the officers has been arrested, which is great if true. I hope they're all brought to justice. Their actions (and lack thereof) were completely unconscionable.
Not a local, am a fed. 5 years into the job. George Floyd was murdered and it’s fucking disgusting. 

We’re trained that anything involving the neck is a no-go and is considered deadly force. 

We were also trained that if you make an arrest in a prone position, you search and then immediately move them onto their side or a seated position because the risk of asphyxiation is so great. If a suspect says they can’t breathe, believe them and take measures to correct to it. 

This training is reinforced at least twice a year in our use of force training. These “officers” deserve to spend the rest of their lives in prison.
Retired after 28 years. Nothing less than murder.  All the guys I worked with would never have considered doing something like that.  You treat combative in-custodies once they’re secured as human beings. Nothing should be personal.  Once they’ve been subdued and you are safe as an officer, you stand him up, pat him down and understand that your arrestee is at a low point in his life.  Give him some dignity and you’ll generally get his respect.  It works 90+% of the time.  

That man was subdued and nobody should have been on him at that point.
I’m a police officer in California. I am absolutely disgusted by the officers’ actions. When someone is in our custody you must treat them properly. I don’t care if they are arrested for murder or forgery. They are a human with a story and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. I had tears streaming down my face watching the video of George Floyd. We swore to protect our communities and that’s what we set out to do everyday. Putting a knee into the neck of a handcuffed man for an extended period of time isn’t protecting. 

A man has lost his life due to the gross negligence of an evil person. May he Rest In Peace.
Cop Here.

Disgusted.

There are a 1000 reasons why this shouldn't have happened. Simple, easy, steps that should have been taken. Lessons that policing has learned over the past 200 years and basic things taught in every academy.

Make no mistake, this was murder. Maybe not premeditated murder, but nonetheless murder.

I will be ANGRY if those officers do not get indicted.

I was a cop in the military. In the police academy this was one of the things the taught us NOT to do as it could crush the wind pipe.  


The only time I was ever taught to use chokes and neck holds was in combat training for deployments . But when we got back we always had to attend retraining classes to relearn what we can do state side.
Sheriffs Deputy here and I must say that I am disgusted by the unnecessary loss of life. There are moments that make me regret what I do, and this is one of them. I've met my share of racists wearing a badge and I'm ready for a career change. The oath we take is to uphold the law and constitution, so for the officers on scene there that could have stepped in and prevented this, fuck you.

One bad apple always ruins the bunch, unfortunately. I pray for the George's family and that justice is served. 

Throwaway for obvious reasons and yes I'm a white male.

Edit: Wasn't expecting this to blowup as it has. Im responding to you guys when I can and I'm glad we can have a conversation about this. 

We do not unionize in my state for Law Enforcement, and I see many comments about systemic protection and abuse. I have never worked under a police union, but I have worked with people who were unionized and I have heard my share of stories where LE is protected by the union ( stories I hear are about union protection from bad leadership ) but I can imagine those protection s may extend further in cases such as this.
As a son of a former police officer, my dad worked really hard to be an honest cop. His department was full of racists.

They didn’t like him because he was a decent cop, they couldn’t do anything wrong on front of him.

We saw the news together and i saw him wipe a tear, but tried really hard to hide it. I know he’s sad and i don’t wanna push him to talk about it, but we both know things like this is always gonna happen, and that is a really sad fact

I can’t possibly understand why a human being would do something like this
I work for a U.S. federal bureau but am not a local police officer. All 4 cops need to go to jail. Derek Chauvin, the cop with the knee on George's neck, should've gone to jail long ago. The guy apparently has a history of doing this. This is his third time in 15 years.

Black people need to keep fighting and white/Asian/Latino people need to support them. Justice for cases like this won't come easy, and it won't come soon. But if they keep fighting, I truly believe that one day, eventually, it will come.
I used to be a police officer. It was fucking embarrassing going out the day after something like this happened. One of the reason I quit was because I had no pride in my job anymore

For the people doubting if i used to be a cop or not, this is the only proof i really have. in order to get the 'police officer' flair on /r/protectandserve you need to send the mods a pic of your police issued ID. havent been to that sub since before i quit but here it is https://imgur.com/a/DUK2Nob
Retired. It disgusts me as the job is difficult enough as it is, working mostly in sensitive neighborhoods. Brutality like this makes it far more difficult.
Since we’re tapping into the police community here, can someone please explain what, if anything, the bystanders could have done to help George Floyd? Call 911 and report police brutality? In all seriousness, what is the preventative action here since none of the police officers on the scene (4 of which were physically restraining him) reacted to his being murdered right in front of them?

Edit: thank you u/murderbymodem for this link [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct). I’m adding it to my post because I think others will appreciate it and I don’t want it to get lost.

Edit: In summary, some of the options proposed are below. I apologize if I omitted, misrepresented, or oversimplified anything. *The bystanders in this case did many of these things and they were a voice for George when he couldn’t speak for himself.*

1. Always record the incident (live streaming if possible) and inform the police they are being recorded. 

2. Involve other authorities when applicable such as police supervisors, state police, 911 (ask for supervisor and an ambulance to report immediately), ACLU, FBI(?). Tell the officers on site that you are involving other authorities. 

3. Deescalation: back any crowd or bystanders away from the scene and officers (while still being able to record the incident). Have one person (preferably a white person) attempt to approach the officer(s) as a medical professional or voice of reason to explain that it appears that medical treatment may be required and remind the officer(s) that their best interests (career, family, reputation etc) are to act responsibly. 

4. Create a diversion/distraction that requires the officers to release the hold (not custody) of anyone in imminent medical danger. 

5. Physically remove the threat imposed by the officer(s) by force (this includes exercising your right to carry and discharge a gun). I think everyone agrees that this option will most likely result in physical (potentially fatal) and legal ramifications for the individual(s) involved unless the group of bystanders are organized enough and outnumber the officers on the scene to the extent that they can safely take control without further harm. 

6. Systemic change: Vote (local and national) for people that value human life and will implement change to protect it (this is not an anti-gun sentiment - if you value your right to carry a gun then vote for people that support that). Be vocal in demanding justice when these incidents occur. Push for improved training, hiring practices, and accountability within the police force. I would imagine that this may also include increasing pay for the police force to attract more suitable individuals into the positions. Possibly implement a citizen based governing body to oversee the police force and their actions.
Serious question to the police officers participating in this discussion, obviously there are a myriad of factors that possibly contributed to this incident, from poor training, to an officer being unfit for duty, etc.

My question is, how is it possible that the three other officers on the scene took no steps to intervene, or at the very least, check on the status of the victim? Is there any reason for their lack of awareness or decision to stand aside while they, along with many other bystanders, can clearly see the man dying in front of them? What justification, if any, is possible in this situation?
Ah, a post I can finally answer!

Based in Scotland, I'm a Police Officer with 5 years service, 2 of which I have been a part-time Officer safety instructor.

During this training we go over retraining subjects and handcuff techniques that we use to a T.  This includes all safety aspects including where to apply handcuffs, how tight they should be, ensuring the technique is done correctly and that the subject is in a controlled but safe position.

Positional asphyxia is a VITAL topic we cover and it is reiterated time and time again that if a subject ends up on the ground we never, and I reiterate again, NEVER, place any sort of weight on them. 
Hell even when sitting in the back of our cars, we watch them and ensure they can breath and are in a comfortable position for transport.

What these cops did was just plain stupid, disproportionate and frankly an embarrassment to Policing.  I'd also use disgusting if I'm honest. 

I just hope that people know we are not like this.

EDIT: This is my first comment and it has received more attention that I could have imagined, which I thank you all for!

To address some points raised in the replies.  I appreciate I work in a far different environment but we still have to restrain subjects while cuffed and at no point has it resulted in an incident like this or even an Officer in the position shown in the video.

I absolutely condemn his actions and this should never have happened.  As for what was going on his head, I have no idea whether it be "red mist" or he thought something else.  Either way he should lose his job and face the full consequences of his action.

Unfortunately some hate, as expected, in some replies which I understand.  However one officer cannot be held accountable for another, so again I hope people understand that this a small minority of the job and the rest are always there to help.  Stay safe folks.
Disgusted, especially by the frequency of these events. 

Glad that I work in a place where we're trained for years before we ever put on a uniform that communication is our greatest tool. 

Sad to know that this is going to happen again and again.

I have a degree in law enforcement and work in corrections in Minnesota. My thoughts are "Fuck that guy." NOBODY is taught to put their knee on a guy's neck and leave it there until he passes out and dies. He may has well have had his hands around the man's neck. If I were to go off the video evidence, the officer should be arrested for murder.
I'd put a serious tag if I were you.
When I went through the academy in 1990,  I had to complete 480 hours of basic mandate training. At that time , someone who wanted to be a hairstylist had to complete 2400 hours of training.  That might be one of the issues as mentioned previously.
My roommate's only been a cop for a few years, but he got into a huge rant about how that is NOT how you choke someone in a way to detain them. The cop should be tried in court for manslaughter at the VERY LEAST, and if they think they can make a case for murder, go for it.
I'm British but live in America. There is such a different mindset to policing back home in my experience, albeit I grew up in the countryside and lived in a quiet City. My friend is an officer today and he was trained to use his words, not his weapons on first instinct. He said you are supposed to police by consent.

It's police service, not force after all.

I know Hot Fuzz is a comedy but when Simon Pegg tells Nick Frost his most important tool is his logbook it's so true.

I never feared the Police when we were out and about back home. Probably because your average bobby doesn't have a gun.

In America, I'm not so sure I have that same confidence. 

Those that join the Police to wield power and fear need to be rooted out. Those that stand by and say nothing of their colleagues who do wrong also need to be gone.
Fucking horrified

Regardless of the act committed, you just don't od that to people.

I seriously question the culture on that team.

EDIT. since some people are being a bit dense.   
I am from another continent (yes other countries exist) .  

Yes I have publicly declared my feelings for this incident on other social media (where my name actually shows).   

No I won't do it on here, because if we have social media accounts with out names on them, they must confirm to our regulations and therefor I have. I place to express myself as a cop and a person at the same time.   
No, I don't care if you don't like that.
Horrified. When you have someone in custody you are responsible for their safety and well being.
Former police officer here. 

It's honestly scary that things like this happen. In the academy (training varies state by state) they teach you PPCT (pressure point control tactics? can't remember). PPCT are pretty much techniques you can use to subdue someone without actually harming them permanently (pain compliance). 

Anytime you perform a technique to incapacitate someone - you cuff the, sit them up  and make sure they are physically ok and have suffered no damage.


One of the things I learned in the academy (2016) is that training between the 1900's to now is vastly different. Back then it was minimal training (could be a couple days, two weeks, etc) and when I went through it was about 600+ hours. Last I heard it was 850+.

Post mandates x amount of training (while employed) per year to maintain your post license. If you have a police officer from the 1980's (example number) that graduated with 100 hours of training, he doesn't get the same training that you get today. He gets to keep working with his 100 hours + yearly acquired amount of training required by post.

There's no reason for this to have happen. To clarify, any time a police has ended someone's life - (most, if not all) departments suspend them with pay and investigate to see if it was justified and if the officer is ok after the event.

My condolences goes out to Floyd and his family.
I have to ask this as an Infantry war veteran for the US. Why are police officers not held to the same standard as our troops? If I were to fire upon or kill an innocent bystander IN A WAR ZONE I would go to prison for murder. How is it that police officers do not suffer the same repercussions? 

It simply does not make sense.
Murder by positional asphyxiation.
My uncle is a retired police officer, and I called him about this:

He said that it's horrible that people like this exist. It's has a negative impact on both the police community and the black community. It stirs up animosity between the two, and they end up not trusting. What if a person in the african american community needs to call the police, but don't trust them/fear them?

 Not all police officers are like this, many are great people, but the growing number of cases is alarming. Another problem is that because of police unions, officer who should face serious reprecussions, aren't.
Former correctional officer.
Once they are in cuffs, as long as they're not spitting, flailing about, or otherwise being extremely aggressive, that's a no go.
Even if they are doing the aforementioned, that's still a no go. Yes, restrain them, but humanely. Sit them down or lay them on their side, but NEVER apply deadly force once they're in cuffs. Doesn't matter if the individual is yelling threats, slander, or being an asshat. Don't do it.
That's textbook. Ya just don't do it. 
When I was in training, we studied the Use Of Force Continuum like it was scripture. Everyday was a scenario. Everyday there were "pop quizzes". Every day, we talked about it, discussed it, and made sure we ALL knew what it meant, what it was, and the proper techniques. 
Once they're in cuffs, that's it. No strikes, holds, or anything more than maintaining contact.

Charge em all, lock em up, throw away the key. Charge the department for lack of training. Launch a 3rd party IA investigation into what happened, as well as into the IA department. Chances are, there's a fuck ton of corruption. Size of the force shouldn't matter when it comes to proper training. End of story. 
Disgrace.
At what point do citizens become empowered to do the right thing? As I watched this video, I got filled with so much hate. Not just for the officer with the knee on this throat, but also for the cop standing there doing nothing. Being a decent human being and tell your partner to chill the fuck out. Not only for the reason that we are being recorded, but because it's the right thing to do. 

Going back to the empowered citizens. As I watched I just felt like someone should've done something. And not just something stupid, but as one human to another, the right thing. His death could've been avoided. And I know that if someone would've done something they too would've been arrested or worse for "interfering with a police investigation" that's their fuckin cop out. Pun not intended.

Thanks for taking the time to read my comment and for replying. I did think about what most of you said before posting, but man with that video evidence, I’m sure 30 days probation or something not as drastic would’ve been the result and maybe a human life would’ve been saved. Or it would have been much worse.
I worked as an intern at a state police intelligence operations center. There was always TV's with the news on. I particularly remember when that UPS driver was caught in the crossfire of a needless firefight with police officers and runaways on the highway. Even in an instance like that the cops I worked with said the same old tropes, "what happened before this." And "the media only covers the bad stuff that happens with cops what about black on black crime." All the garbage you always hear after this happen right from the mouth of the horse in their state HQ. So to all the "cops of reddit" I see on this thread that are saying this is shameful and whenever it happens y'all are ashamed and find it disgusting. Then hold each other accountable because in the police HQ I worked at the culture that allows these things to happen was readily apparent. The experience I had at that internship made me drop any notion of a career in Intel and law enforcement because the culture was based on victimization of cops and racism. Do better.
Deputy sheriff here. I was horrified and couldn’t believe my eyes. There’s an arrest technique to have your foot up against the shoulder/neck with your knee is across the top of their back, but never on the neck. That’s just to gain control until you cuff. Having your knee on someone’s neck makes no sense at all, especially for that long. My department always has refresher training on positional asphyxiation and excited delirium. This should have never happened. He’s cuffed, get him in the car and be done with it. 

It’s the cops that pull crap like this that make the job harder and harder. They deserve everything they got coming to them. We have an obligation to to protect life and they all failed. Some cops seriously take the job too seriously and do stupid things. I just want to go to work, go home, and feed my family.
I will chime in here. I agree with the retired officer.  Policing in communities where there often is legitimate reasons to not trust the police, well, it’s hard. You do a lot to not get in over your head. You need to be fair and human! As far as police brutality. Good cops who want to stay good need to buck up and report bad behavior in their fellow officers. You know what matters more than my job or career, the responsibility to the public! Once I responded to a call of a black male being belligerent in public. Turns out the male was younger, drunk, and trying to gain entry to his own residence. Sure, if you want a stat you can maybe get disorderly conduct, but that is unnecessary. The truth and discretion dictated an easy fix here. Another alpha male type officer showed up. He begins to rile up the drunk male. He is being aggressive to the male for no reason. It was totally immature. I turn around and when I go back I see the male is in handcuffs and then I see the alpha male cop picking the black male up by his neck about a foot off the ground. By his throat! Neighbors are watching, everyone has a camera. But beyond this you must be fair and moral. This officer was an idiot. I had to report it and the officer was disciplined and eventually fired I believe. I was a young officer and was nervous. You know you can make enemies even when you are right. Well I would do that all again. Bad behavior is not to be accepted. It’s one reason I’m not in policing now.
Those cops should be buried under the jail. I condemn all 4 of those officers actions and hope they get what they deserve.
I am in Law Enforcement and I have yet to meet an officer that didn’t cringe and wonder what the actual fuck was happening. Everyone I know in the law enforcement community not only feels terrible for this man and his family, but also feels discouraged and disheartened by how much fuel this adds to an already difficult to control fire of distrust in the community. There are officers that work day in and day out to try and fix the image and perception of policing because they care. These heinous abuses of power make their jobs harder. It’s impossible to heal a wound that keeps getting ripped open. 

It doesn’t take Law Enforcement training to know and understand that when you apply pressure to someone’s neck, you’re blocking off blood to their brain and air to their lungs. 

This wasn’t just a case of bad training. This was a case of lack of basic humanity.
Not a Peace Officer, but I work in a jail, for an SO in a different state. I’m outraged. Not only at the dipshit who used a technique that even jailers are explicitly taught never to do, but also at the jackass who stood there and did nothing. We have a very strict Tap-Out Rule, when engaged in a Use of Force so that if you see someone losing control, or just blatantly disregarding training/SOP, you should tap them out of the situation. This didn’t happen. He didn’t even try. Neither did the other 2 who the video doesn’t show. I really hope he gets charged and convicted. 2nd degree murder for Chauvin, misconduct of a public officer at a minimum for all 4, and the other 3 who’s names I do not know should get whatever the accessory to murder equivalent is in MN. The accessory charges may not stick, but the charges should be filed as a statement

I also think that the 3 Officers not stepping up points to an agency issue that needs to be addressed. In this job you should never feel that you can’t voice a concern to a superior/more veteran officer/anyone. Administrative concerns have a method. Life saftey concerns should not. The Chief is fairly new, but is a long time MPD Officer and may not be able to fix the problem.
If I did this shit in Iraq I would have gone to Leavenworth

Think about that
Alternatively: cops of Reddit, when you see your colleagues and brothers in blue doing heinous shit, what do you do to intervene and take a stand, to get rid of the so-called bad apples?
This may get buried by all the comments by non-police officers, but I am a US police officer in a decent-sized city (population of about 500,000).  I am proud of my career and my department. I think my department is lucky to have pretty strong support in our community. Support comes from trust that when a citizen has to come in contact with the police in some way, they will be treated with respect. 

Regardless of what kind of training those officers had or lacked, no one with common sense or good intentions would kneel on someone’s neck, especially after they’d been handcuffed, while they stated multiple times that they couldn’t breathe. At no point in the academy was I taught that knee-to-the-neck was an appropriate hold for a suspect. In fact, I WAS taught about positional asphyxiation. And that a “choke hold” or carotid restraint that cuts off circulation to the brain is deadly force. 

When a combative suspect is handcuffed and is no longer able to hurt you, you sit them up and call for medical if they were injured during the arrest. I have made and assisted with many, many arrests and nothing I saw in the George Floyd video is normal. I can’t even fathom what that officer was thinking. 

As far as the officers standing by, helping to hold Mr. Floyd down, and failing to intervene when he says he can’t breathe... unacceptable. My department’s policy says that officers shall intervene if they are witnessing a fellow officer using excessive force. Regardless of whether the officer using excessive force is a 30 year vet and the witness is a rookie. If it’s a sergeant and the witness is his/her subordinate. These are people’s lives at stake and police officers have too much power if we aren’t willing to police each other. 

I rarely make judgments on fellow officers without knowing the whole story, but the video of George Floyd’s arrest is enough. Mr. Floyd was murdered and those officers had every opportunity to change the outcome of that situation. They are not worthy of their badge. I’m relieved that their department was decisive enough to immediately fire them and I fully expect they will be prosecuted. 

I’ve seen many people commenting, “Why don’t police officers speak up?” and “Why do the police continue to participate in this corruption?” We aren’t ‘participating’. If we stop showing up to work and doing our jobs, violence and crime will rule. I haven’t talked to a single officer who isn’t disgusted by what happened in Minneapolis. I’m incredibly angry because the actions of those cops put a target on every other cop’s back - good cops who would never, ever do something like that. The law enforcement community as a whole is in agreement that George Floyd’s death was completely unacceptable and unnecessary. 

If anyone bothered to read this, please don’t condemn all police because of the actions of those few. There’s no excuse for it, but the vast majority of police officers are truly good people. And... rioting to the point that property is destroyed and people get hurt doesn’t help anything.
I like talking into it and sounding like a robot
I’m still waiting for my only fan so I can afford one
[removed]
I'm Korean and I enjoy the thrill of electric fans. You just don't get that genuine life-or-death scenario with ACs. 

Source: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death
im an average fan enjoyer
It took me way too long to get this joke.  I need more coffee.
[deleted]
I can't have sex with an air conditioner.
The sound of the fan drowns the deafening silence of dread in my life
I used to have aircon, but then i switched to only using fan as it really helps me wake up better in the morning. My mouth is less dry and it makes waking up easier too since i wont drag my waking up from being too comfy.
Sweat is a free lubricant. I can deal with the downsides.
The fan chops up the oxygen molecules and makes it more easier for me to suck em down.


 Edit:
 A silver for this comment?
 Thank you. I feel like that prostitute in pretty woman.
Unlock this answer for 70$
I tried posting my foot pictures into the air con but the engineer kept looking at me weird when he had to come repair it for the third time.
I'll call tomorrow.
Because an air conditioner won't show me it's butthole for 2.99 a month.
costs too much on my power bill, i live on the ocean and the breeze is my air conditioner
[deleted]
I'm a Mac user, so no windows.
I think they don't need air conditioning, because they like to be naked.
Millions of years of evolution did not prepare me for this
That took me longer than I'd like to admit...
Since I rent there's not really a good place to put an air-conditioner. Fans are more flexible and get the job done pretty well.
The electricity bill
Fans are cool
*Da-a-a-a-d!!*
AC can cause green house effect and I'm doing my part in saving the earth. Except when it is 34°C and above then my stand might waver.
Mine has a really solid fan base. I'd like to hold on to that.
I just open Windows.
My Only Fan™️ model is still working well enough.
I live in the UK. Don't even have a fan. A few weeks each year (at most) it's hot and I ask my husband to agree to us buying a fan, every year he says it's not worth it.
People saying they can't have sex with an airconditioner, how exactly do you stick your schlong on a super fast rotating machine?
If I'm not hot, how will I make money?
England is what's stopping me lol...
I hardly have to use the ceiling fan I have
In the UK weather and temperature can vary so much that permanent air conditioning is too expensive to justify and air conditioning doesn’t come as standard in most homes. Instead we have a good quality fan that we can use when the need arises. Since sunny days are few and far between we just make do on really hot days.
saving the planet, and my finances, win win.
This dude is fucking his a/c unit
I am poor
Because with an AC I can’t say “Babe show me your butt hole” while also sounding like Darth Vader.
I'm from Britain I only need fans on for like 2 months, air conditioning in a house is an alien concept to me
I’m a simple man, I see tits and I subscribe... wait what???
thought this was r/circlejerk for a sec. For shame on that subreddit for getting outdone.
Fuck this post
An air conditioner is nice and all, but it only blows you, it can't chop your dick so that's a disadvantage
I sleep in the fridge
I like the sound it makes when it's turned on
It's way more portable, I can bring it to any room in the house and still be blown right away.
we wanted to upgrade but the land lord wont allow it and now we are getting thrown out here so we are kind of happy we didnt drop any money on getting the AC installed
I actually have Only Heater, but that's because it functions as both.
Like after I close the app and come back or if I accidentally press the "back" button and go to the top?
Anyone else get so depressed when the page closes and you know you can never go back?
I'd like to see how it works first ... Like a test
Yes please
I would feel great about no more “how would you feel” questions on this sub.
Just get Apollo.
I feel that these circlejerk type questions that start with 'How would you feel..' should be banned.
Ugh, we're doing these "How you feel about X for Reddit?" again?
Someone please start the petition it is very necessary
Who the fuck would say no to this? What a shitty post.
How would you feel about banning low effort “how would you feel” questions from AskReddit?
[deleted]
[deleted]
The same way as banning these questions. pleasantly surprised
bruh stop with these questions, literally everyone wants it
Yeah, why isn't that a thing already?

I press back by mistake regularly, and that's generally when I'm done with reddit for the day.
You mean for when my phone just scrolls all the way to the top of the feed for no fucking reason at all?
[removed]
Reddit has become so circlejerky and hive-minded that it always is like that anyways
Yes please. Idk how but I always accidentally press the logo to go back to the top just as I’m about to read something interesting
Yes, and maybe even a, "are you sure you want to go back to top" feature when you press back on keyboard/mobile so people don't need the "where you left off" button
Could be bad for people posting/viewing NSFW subs
Thanks for reminding me this isn't a feature and giving me anxiety.
Why? Just set it to hide any posts you either up voted or down voted and refresh whenever you want. Bam, endless stream of fresh posts.
This happens and I just figure it's time to fall asleep.
no wtf lol. No way I wanna wake up to all the weird shit I was reading about at 2am the previous night
Or an option for posts to disappear from your feed once you up or down vote....
It's called Red Reader. It's fabulous. Latest version has some nice new features, too.

Sometimes it takes a while to load... But it caches things, so no more than a few seconds if you're really really far down the infinite scroll.
Given how othen I have to force close the app from its issues, yes please give me this.
I’d prefer it if the feed just reset when I refreshed rather than just randomly when it Fucking wants
Ironically I accidentally hit back twice and found this at the top. Yes I would love that!
I feel like a mode where all my porn subreddit subscriptions are only viewable at night would be a better investment
Yes, 100% yes
How i feel about it? Yes
Pretty cool idea.
Yes. Please.
Ambivalent.
I think it would be great if apps like reddit and Facebook had a way of managing certain things - like jumping back to the post feed that accidentally got refreshed, or even a history of post feed that have been presented to you would be a step further. This feels along those lines to me so I'd be all for it
Since this isn't really a question (who on earth *wouldn't*), I'll take a moment to recommend the Apollo app for iOS. It has that feature along with many others the official products don't have. A bug was recently discovered and was fixed within days.
Hitting the scroll to top button accidentally is part of the reddit experience.  Reddit is a harsh master.
We would call it the “fuck go back” button
Plot twist: OP is a Reddit developer and is asking us if we want the update
Why would I care for it on Reddit?
I feel asleep at some point during 2019 and would like to return to that, please
Yas pls
Ask us if We would like to have every action on this platform tracked and aggregated as a user level. 

Because that’s what this requires.
Sometimes when you click on a post and exit, it would put you in a different spot than before which is annoying
I’d feel good
I would like it
Hell yes
Literally every other social media app I use has it, it would be great.
Please
I'll take your entire stock
If I can remember where I left off on reddit, that would be nice.
How would you feel about something that has literally no fucking downside- people on this subreddit
And relive my 3am madness in the morning? Nah
Hi I am a reddit user and I approve of this message.
Oh man, this and a feature that lets me organize my saved posts. Something where I can more easily figure out what I've saved, maybe group by custom categories or by sub, give me something so I dont have to scroll down for hrs on my app to see a post i saved a year ago.
I’d prefer a ‘don’t show me posts I’ve seen before’ button. 

Seriously, how difficult would it be? Reddit knows every post we’ve seen / scrolled through / upvoted / downvoted. Just have a checksum for images and videos, and remove those from our feed that are in our existing viewed content database
How about a no one allowed to comment under the age of 16?
Best idea ever. It is so incredibly frustrating that as you been scrolling for a while. And you leave for one minute you have to start over. Usually I dont bother anymore then
I hate it when you leave the app for so long that it has to reload but the last page you were on isn’t in your history
Slap me in the face and take my money. Just give it to me.
we need it
You can stick this right up your functional search bar.
Yes please but I’d be happy if it didn’t go to the top if I breathe on the left side of my screen
I WOULD EAT IT AND TAKE A MASSIVE POOP AND DO IT FOR 28482737252739262637482862272828272839272627383728392727 YEARS.
Wait, why hasn’t this been done yet????
I think it's a great idea, but Reddit should consider a working video player first lol
Your ideas are powerful, keep honing it for good.
Please
Fucking do it I've lost so many great posts because my phone is laggy and the app will either freeze or stutters and refresh.
I NEED THIS




i am not screaming at you, but it would be useful.
How about a fuck go back button for when I accidentally hit the back button on my phone and it takes me all the way to the top
Yeah why not
I just want a stable functioning official app. I had no problem with the app a couple of months ago, but ever since they introduced profile pics, they keep fucking it up. The profile pics also keep going away and coming back after each update but that's the least of the apps worries. Now whenever you scroll right and hit a video, the whole thing auto expands and freezes so you don't even know what subreddit you are stuck on.
I'd go on my friends phone and go to a gay subreddit just to mess with him when he decides to go to where he left off
I like that idea.  I'd also like a "don't go down that rabbit hole electric zapper" to protect myself from going down too many rabbit holes.
That would be great
How about a hide shit you’ve already seen button.
I just want a proper working search function.
I would feel... Refreshed.
This would be awesome. I’ve so often tapped the home button or the top of the screen showing my girlfriend memes I come across, it’d be so nice to be able to press the home button again and it goes back to where I was before I fat thumbed it.
Feel?  Just do it.
OP crosspost this to r/beta and it’ll probably get added in. They’ll see all the comments on here
I'll just leave this here [From the latest Sync for Reddit beta ](https://i.imgur.com/Ql9xyJv.jpg)...
Might not be necessary if Reddit had an actual, functioning search bar.
I’ve become comfortable with the ephemeral. It’s not possible to see **everything** so I get the chance to enjoy what comes up without it feeling inevitable. 

Were this to be implemented, I fear I’d start hoarding posts and needing to read every post or get anxious from having not “completed” all of the unread posts/having a large backlog to get through. My enjoyment of the content would suffer.
I may be late to the party but, on the official Reddit app on my phone, there is a "history" tab(button?) to see your recent well...history.

Sauce: I am posting from the "history" option.
Are you offering to program one in?
Great considering that it just happened to me and this is the first thing I saw
That'd be a blessing from the Gods, right?
Why don't they just give a final conformation before we want to refresh?
Just like a little quick save of your place? Possibly being able to name it if you so choose but probably not? Yeah, I'd be down
I need a save article button or some way to search. 

There was an article I saw that I wanted to find again. 

It was an ask Reddit question to blind people and what they found attractive about their partners or how they knew they were attracted to someone. 

Can anyone  help?
I feel like your just asking for upvotes since you know how everyone wants this jk lol i would love it
HE IS THE MESSIAH
nah, I love clicking to read an article and then going back to find the post  has completely vanished.
PLEASE
The fuck does this have 100k upvotes. Everyone has said it before, long before, and everyone knows.
"nnn-noooo!"
 
"here we go again"
I WOULD PAY FOR IT (not really but I would send thoughts and prayers)
I'd feel good, but I'd feel better if my page wouldn't erase everything on it or re-order it into oblivion every time I accidentally refresh mobile. Let me click something to bring in new threads.
How about a never see the same post twice and filter out all reposts feature?
I would love it
Please.
Relieved
Please
I just realized that this is one of the few posts here with 100K+ upvotes. If I posted the same, no one would see it. :(
there's a history of posts you've looked at lol
I would love it! I always lose my place and it’s really annoying
I just want to know who would actually be opposed to this
I’d like that, sometimes I can’t remember a post for the life of me and want to see it again but I had to exit the app because of something going on outside.
I’m relatively sure I’d cry if that became an option. I’m forever either hitting the wrong button or it glitches and kicks me off.
Agreed need a return icon
Honestly, does no one know that you can change your settings to hide posts that you’ve upvoted or downvoted?
I'd be happy if it would stop bouncing me up to the top of the page at random times for no apparent reason.
I’d rather be able to block certain subs
Awesome! I get so disgusted when I accidentally get sent back to the top, I just close out of the app.
They shouldn't add that so people can farm this exact post over and over for awards and points
Nah.  I like the Travolta in Pulp Fiction GIF feeling
I would just wish I had left off in 2015.
Honestly, Reddit is so time consuming that sometimes the odd take-me-back-to-the-top-of-the-page-so-that-it-is-physically-impossible-for-me-to-return-to-where-I-was can be a good motivation to close the app and deal with my life.
Brushing my teeth
Welp it’s the 22nd in Australia so I guess I missed it
Looking at the clock at 9:32.
Well, NOW I'll have to watch the clock
..so I guess that's what I'll be doing
Surfing reddit.
Shouldn't we wait for the 21st month to do this???
Probably forgetting about it
Whoever was born at 9:21, 21 years ago, is probably pretty stoked.
Sleep
Shit, only 4 minutes to plan...panicking!
Its 22nd and 6 am . I was playing pokemon btw.
Working :(
Trying to sleep but instead staring at my ceiling having an existential crisis.
Isnt it the 9:21 during the 22nd hr?
21 Savage has entered the chat *
Masturbating furiously.
This is wrong...

8:20:20 was the time. Centuries are 1-indexed, times are 0-indexed. Midnight is the 1st hour, 1am is the 2nd hour, etc.
I'm posting this comment literally as the clock is turning to 9:21
Playing Blackjack.
At that exact moment (which has passed for me, I’m in Ireland) I was watching Liverpool lose their home record to Burnley. 2021 is going to be fuckin shite.
I read this at 9:22 🙁

9:26

FUCK
The same thing we do every night, Pinky. TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!
I hope someone somewhere is hitting a blackjack at a casino.
Isn’t 2021 the 22nd year of the 21st century?
I made the decision to not end my life, and to put down the bottle. Wish me luck, friends, I've been through this battle many times in my life, but I feel that this is the last one.

Having a cigar and a beer.
Well now I’m panicking for no reason because I found this at 9:20 exactly lol
I found this post at exactly 9:22. I feel like I just narrowly missed learning some deep, cosmic secrets to the universe or something.
I will be grateful to be alive and well!!
Doing homework.
I'M A MINUTE LATE, NOOOOO! I told my boyfriend and my dog I loved them though.
8:20, not 9:21. The first minute of the first hour of a given day is 12:00.
Drinking a beer
being in a different timezone where its already the 22nd.
Amazingly, finding this post.
The time will be 21:21, but that's actually the 22nd hour and 22nd minute, as 00:00 is the first hour of the day and first minute of the hour.

Moral of the story: use 24h time.
Same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try to take over the world!
2020 was 21st year of the century. Sry.

Edit: I am wrong

Found this at the perfect time! It's in 1 minute! I'll be staring at the clock and smiling! OH LOOK! I am now!
Casting spells
Not giving a shit
It’s the 22nd for me
You have been waiting for this haven’t you?
Watching Critical Role. Very excited for more interactions with Lucien.
Ah fuck, I missed it.
Hate to ruin your special moment, but the first hour of the 21st day began at midnight, making the 21st hour actually 8:00 PM, also the 21st minute was 8:20. So...

Congrats to Biden!

Thanks for the tip. I’ll make sure to be masturbating.
I was writing a message to my dad telling him how much I love him and I hope his birthday was good. He spent it alone at home and I can’t help but feel so guilty.
Everyone is in here arguing about the year, but the time is the thing that's wrong lol
I thought this year is the 22nd year of 21st century 🤔🤔🤔
Idk. masturbate probably?
Same thing i always do.. Gaming
Hopefully getting off work.
Hello, post from 21 days ago.
shut the fuck up no one cares
No one cares about this bullshit
You could literally post this every year just with different numbers, and some of the numbers in this post are wrong. How does shit like this get up votes.
I actually really enjoyed this! I just realized a delivered a baby and watched the mom bond during the first minute of life at 21:21 today.
I'm a mom of a pre-schooler and I have a full-time paying job. So... crying...
I think I was crying around that time
I was watching Jeopardy!, RIP Alex <3
I missed this one
I'll be getting tired of seeing this dumb shit
What a retarded question

Parent/teacher conferences at my international school. Being paid to sit here and browse reddit because millionaires here generally don't give a fuck about their children's education. They will all get good jobs through nepotism and cronyism, no matter how shitty the kid is...

I opened Reddit and this was on my home feed at exactly 9:21. fuck yeah
Just checked the time when I saw this, and it was 9:21. Just passed to 22 as I type this. I have infinite luck for the year I now I guess.
I didn't realize. I think I was probably just brushing my dogs' teeth
I kissed my girlfriend, and I'm damn proud of it!

Apparently looking at this.
I'm reading this at 9:21
It’s that time right now!  I’m laying in bed with my dog sleeping with his head on my arm.  The best.
Reading this apparently.
Reading this post
When I was 5 my mom read me George’s Secret Key to the Universe, that book shaped my earliest years, making me obsessed with being as smart as Stephen Hawking. Thank you Mr. Hawking, and I’m so sorry Lucy Hawking for your loss.
He has been one of the world's most iconic people for my entire life. I cannot recall a time when I didn't know who he was. We just lost a legend.
For those who don't know, he was diagnosed with ALS when he was 21 years old in 1963.

At the time he was given a life expectancy of 2 years. The man had some serious fight in him
A quote from him that I think many of you would enjoy: 

"People who boast about their IQ are losers."
My aunt was diagnosed with ALS 18 months ago. 10 months ago she was driving and now she has a feeding tube. This disease terrifies me and I am so afraid for her. I am so grateful for all the attention Stephen Hawking brought towards ALS. And his cameo on the simpsons. 
Bloody good effort to make it to 76 with that illness.

Thank you for all your contributions to our world, Stephen.

Rest in peace, mate.
We just lost one of the greatest scientific minds of our time. But at least we had him for the time that we did, against all odds. 

RIP
It's kinda surreal reading this, feel weird right now.
"Although I cannot move, in my mind I am free." -Stephen Hawking

This is a really random quote that stuck with me forever. I don't have any disease like him, but I still feel trapped and stuck by this body, by a system, by relationships, by responsibilities. So the only way I could escape that is in my mind through writing and creating stories. In my mind, I can do and be and exist however I want.

Rest in Peace, great mind of the century.
After seeing a trailer for The Theory of Everything, my wife was surprised to find out he had ALS.

Wife: If he is paralyzed how does he write **all** those books?

Me: There's not too many, but I am sure it takes an extremely long time and...

_Short Pause_

Me: You know Stephen Hawking and Stephen King are two different people right?

Wife: Oh...
Stephen Hawking was born on the 300th anniversary of Galileo's death (January 8th, 1942), and passed away on Albert Einstein's birthdate (March 14th). I can't even begin to describe how cool that is
Whaaaat? This totally caught me off guard. I actually thought it was fake. 

He gave it a good go though. Expected to die young, lives longer than most. 
A royal shame. Fantastic though that he stuck with us this long. He may not have believed in life after death, but in the words of Ernest Hemingway, *"Every man has two deaths, when he is buried in the ground and the last time someone says his name. In some ways men can be immortal."*

Live long Stephen Hawking, live long.
They gave you 2 years in 1963. God may not play dice with the universe, but you beat the odds anyway.

Rest in peace Professor. 
Hail to the greatest Min-Maxer of our time! Despite rolling close to a 0 for Constitution, his Intelligence score actually gave him a bonus that allowed him to live far longer than even people with average scores. 

Your accomplishments will echo far beyond the time we got to share with you. Rest in Peace, Professor Hawking
Rest in peace, Stephen Hawking. You’re back amongst the stars you loved. 
Stephen Hawking has always been one of the biggest reasons why I've pursued physics and quantum mechanics. He has served as a reminder that I should never give up on my love of science. I am truly saddened and shocked to hear of his death.

We'll see you on the other side, Stephen. Rest in peace buddy. 
One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away
I hope he is revered and remembered in the future as much as Einstein, Newton, and the other greats.

He will be sorely missed. Such a great sense of humor. The only guest to have appeared on Star Trek as himself.

What an amazing man. Given 2 years to live and makes it to 2018. We were lucky to have him around as long as we did. We just lost a once in a generation mind. 
>**I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first**

Stephen Hawking


A Brief History of Time rocketed Hawking to stardom.   
>Published for the first time in 1988, the title made the Guinness Book of Records after it stayed on the Sunday Times bestsellers list for an unprecedented 237 weeks. 


His life was played out in biographies and documentaries, most recently *The Theory of Everything,* in which Eddie Redmayne played him. “**At times I thought he was me**,” Hawking said on watching the film. 


BRB gotta watch the movie and feel numb. 
The world has lost a shining star.
"I believe the simplest explanation is, there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization that there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that, I am extremely grateful."

- Stephen Hawking

Man, my jaw actually dropped while reading this.

The man’s put through a lot. I’m glad that he didn’t just pass away, but he passed leaving people inspired and filled with knowledge.
I loved that he had a sense of humor and made several cameos on Futurama and The Simpsons where [they made his character kind of a jerk.](https://youtu.be/AW-p8s_HCCo)
“Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.”

Couldn’t agree more. 
I got into physics because a brief history of time.  I'm going to graduate this year in aerospace engineering partly because of his book. Rip
"I have noticed even people who claim everything is predestined, and that we can do nothing to change it, look before they cross the road."

-RIP Stephen Hawking - He's crossed thousands of scientific roads without looking at all
Doctors gave him 2 years, but his legacy will last for decades. He made the most of his life, what an incredible man.

I wish I could've met him once in my life, discuss with him around a dinner.
And he died on 3.14 pi day, or 14.3 over the pond
Who is going to be the next generation's iconic genius? A great loss to mankind. Rest in peace.
Man what a drag. Wasn't expecting to see this before bed. 

RIP

It's incredible to think that someone with that condition could make it that long. We should feel lucky that we got to see his contribution for as long as we did 
Even though I haven’t read any of his research or his work, I know that he has made a tremendous impact on society and other people.

RIP and thank you for everything you’ve done for our world Professor.
Diagnosed with ALS in his 20's doctors gave him 5 years to live tops

He managed to make it all the way to 76. On the way he proved that black holes actually emit a form of radiation contrary to the previously held believe that they are inescapable for all forms of matter; and inspired an entire generation of young scientists. Hawking is a model that not just scientists but all people everywhere alike should strive to be like.

When i was growing up, we would call smart people einstein. No doubt Hawking will become the einstein of younger generations, and his legacy remembered forever

RIP Hawking, thank you for everything

It is uncommon for a single human to effect as many people's lives as Stephen Hawking has. This is devastating to all. May such a magnificent man rest in piece. 
I did not realize he was 76, already. It seems like... He just seemed that he would continue on, hed already beaten every odd of living. Why not 80, why not 90 even. 76 is freaking amazing though, unbelievable
He had 2 years to live and nearly made it 50. Insanely great reminder to treat every day like it matters.

Hope his contributions inspire a better generation.
I just can’t believe he’s dead absolutely insane to me. A guy I’ve known about almost my entire life. Feels surreal. I think this is the first death that’s hit me this hard. RIP Stephen Hawking by far one of the smartest people to ever live.
We've lost another brilliant mind,  
A bittersweet goodbye,  
Now Steve can leave his chair behind,  
The Hawk is in the sky.
[deleted]
At first I thought this was parody.... it'll be weird to not have him in society 
It's a terrible day for rain.
We still needed him. 
"The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge." RIP.


I hope he gets to see the universe.
Feels surreal right now.
"We are all now connected by the Internet, like neurons in a giant brain." - Stephen Hawking, scientist and redditor.
Rip, man had more fight in him then a raging bull.

For anyone sad or need something more light-hearted, here is [Hawking's character in ERB completely destroying einstein lyrically.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn7-fVtT16k) (character as in someone playing and representing rather then him playing the role, also is the BEST turn taken out of every ERB ever.)
The fuck do you say to this? Arguably *the* smartest person is human history is DEAD. 

Is this how people felt when Einstein died?

Rest In Peace, Stephen Hawking
What a fuckin' dude.

Guy lived a life way beyond what anyone could have possibly expected of him. Took the cards he was dealt and went "well that's just not fuckin' good enough".

Legend.
This might be the saddest celebrity death of my life so far. What an amazing man and human being.
Caught unexpectedly. One of the greatest losses of the generation.

Rest In Peace, Mr. Hawking.
I just went to a concert tonight, and one of the showstopping numbers includes a quote from Richard Dawkins that I always find very moving. When I came home and found out Stephen Hawking had passed, I was reminded of the quote that so often makes me stop and think. If anyone embodies the sentiment, he does.

"After sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with color, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn't it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it?"
I appreciate him and all he did but...

Why is this on askreddit?
He was born exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo, and died on Pi day.

That's enough coincidences that I bet that someone just as brilliant as him, or maybe moreso, was born today.

Or at least I'd like to hope.
It's a dark day for science. 

Rest in piece Dr. Hawking.
RIP. 'Life would be tragic if it weren't funny'.  https://i.imgur.com/7xoV8sJ.jpg
Rest well Stephen. 

One man with lives for 55 years with ALS while the rest of the worlds medical professionals struggle to keep patients alive for more than 3. What did Stephen teach his doctor?
Rip mr. Hawking ):
I looked at this and thought, "this can't be real". Then I looked him up and it is all over the news. I mean, this just proves that time flies by. One day, he's teaching people about the multiverse theory and then the next, poof! Man, may he rest in peice.
why is this on askreddit
Does this mean the world is ending?
Why is this on /r/askreddit?
And what is the question?
Why is this posted in r/AskReddit? What is the question?
Rest In Peace
RIP one of the greatest minds to ever lived.
Thank you for everything Stephen.
I shouldn't be as surprised as I am. But... I am. 
Probably the closest thing most of us still living will ever see to an Einstein.
Two pet ducks. You may be tempted to go for one. But trust me. You need two. And you’ll have about $76 left over.

Edit: Fully humbled by the awards, kind friends.
Nice try Jeff Bezos

Another monitor.  Your productivity will increase dramatically.
A nasal irrigation kit - either the electronic pump or simply the squeeze bottles. I started using them both leading up to surgery on my sinuses, and I haven't stopped using them since. It takes some getting used to, but the relief and clean feeling is amazing.
AeroPress coffee maker. The thing broke my wife of her $200(?) monthly Starbucks habit. The unit costs maybe $25 or so.
House plants. They will make you happy looking after them. I recently bought a venus fly trap, she caught her first fly today. So proud.
Rice cooker. That fucker kept me fed during depression when I barely had the energy to get out of bed. Takes less than nothing to get some rice in there and flip the switch. Want something sweet? Throw coconut and sugar in there. Want flavor but can’t be fucked to make anything? Get some spanish rice or saffron goin. You can throw tofu in there with it if you need . Yeah it’s not the best for you but hot food is better than no food.
New pair of socks. If you’ve been wearing the same pairs forever like I typically usually do theirs nothing like putting on a new pair of freshly bought socks, you can totally feel the difference, I never realized til was an adult sadly but I appreciate the feeling of new socks all the time.
I bought a $1 back scratcher from an asian market in town.      
Best $1 I ever spent.
A decent light wake up alarm clock. Completely changed my mornings. Don’t think I could ever go back to using my phone or a simple alarm clock.
If you have trouble getting up or functioning in the morning, and like a nice cup of coffee or tea, an electric kettle with a timer can be a real game-changer. Or just getting an electric kettle if you don't have one.
Vertical mouse. $20. Saved my wrist using it at work all day.

It looks odd but it feels so much more natural. I even got a bunch of people at my office to buy one after they tried mine.

Edit: [Here’s the link](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-Vertical-Ergonomic-Optical/dp/B00BIFNTMC/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=vertical+mouse&qid=1595422956&sprefix=vertic&sr=8-3) to the one I have for those interested.
A king sized blanket for a queen sized bed.
[removed]
This post cost me over 400$ so far
Sharp knives for the kitchen
A glass breaker on a keychain. Push it against the glass of your car window and it shatters immediately, helping you get out of a car underwater,  broken door etc. Super cheap and life saving
In my opinion definitely a weighted blanket if you have a hard time sleeping at night or have anxiety. They have some at target for $25 currently :)
Motion sensor night lights. Can’t tell you how many stubbed toes or falls they have prevented. Also a cheap intruder alarm.
Carbon monoxide detector
More than one 10mm socket.
Blackout curtains for your bedroom.
May sound simple, but a good pillow. It is amazing the change in body aches, and sleep you see when you have a good pillow that fits you.
Sunscreen.

No skin cancer for me
An air compressor to air up your tires. Got one off Amazon for 30 bucks.
A 10 foot charging cable 

Or a quality pair of shoes
National park annual pass
If you have a large lawn or a property that requires a lot of yard work get some [3M Worktunes](https://www.amazon.com/3M-WorkTunes-Protector-Bluetooth-Technology/dp/B0723CYHPZ). About $50 and they're combination hearing protection and Bluetooth headphones so you can actually hear your music  without destroying your eardrums.

They're a good gift too for anyone you know with a lawn or wood shop or something.

At my old house it was a 4-5 hour ordeal to mow and trim the property. I'd likely have went fully insane without those.
Step 1: Throw away all your socks. 

Step 2: Buy 3-5 packages of the same sock. 

Step 3: Enjoy a life without ever having to match socks again.
A good shop vac. You will not believe how many uses around the house you'll find for it. Cobweb removal, water removal, gravel removal, vent cleaning, soot trap cleaning, (after a good scrub since it's likely dirty from other tasks) car vacuuming, dust sucking, the list goes on. Seriously if you plan to buy or already own a home go get a shop vac.
Fitted sheet straps. They keep cheap sheets from popping up at the corners. So now I can use soft sheets that don't cost a fortune and my sleep is undisturbed by them popping loose, greatly improving my quality of life.
Condoms
A basic skincare routine.

I’m talking like cleanse, moisturize, sunscreen, and if you’re really adventurous/ in need, get yourself a topical for acne or concerns. 
Amazing for your self esteem, and also becomes a form of self care eventually. It’s so easy to forget to take care of yourself.
First Aid Kit
Light hearted, but... a pressure cooker! You can get one for around $100, and it can easily cook a genuinely staggering variety of food, and cook it well.

EDIT: TIL there are two types of people that use pressure cookers... people who use them to cook food, and people who use them to make bombs.

Foam roller
An electric kettle. (I'm American)
A dash cam for your car can protect you from wrongful claims also vandalisms and theft
A good showerhead. I cannot stress enough how a high quality showerhead can turn getting clean into utterly zen, 30 minute self healing and relaxation session.

Edit: ok clarification, I don't shower for 30 min every day. Modern rain showerheads use very little water and I only have about 15 min to get ready in the morning so this is a rare treat I let myself do once or twice a month. I appreciate the loving comments.
24(M), I bought a book online about SQL for like 25 bucks and then a course on Udemy for like 11.99?

But went from a job earning 35,000 to 55,000 because I took time to learn a new skill. 

And if I end up staying and becoming a higher level analyst, salary is around 70~75k 

Maybe data analysis isn’t your gig, but learning a skill can be cheap in terms of money: more time consuming than anything but worthwhile.
A good chef's knife and a cast iron skillet. When you have tools that are satisfying to use, cooking becomes less "chore" and more "hobby". You'll end up eating healthier, cheaper than takeout/restaurant, and ditching the dull Walmart knife and scratched up nonstick aluminum skillet are the best place to start.

Editing to add:

Since so many are asking what to get: Victorinox 8" or 10" chef's knife, and 10" lodge cast iron skillet. These in my opinion are at the tippy top of the curve on quality to price ratio. 

These probably leave enough room in the budget to get a $2 steel from goodwill and a large butcher block cutting board. As long as you use the steel with some regularity, a good knife should go a long time before it actually needs to be sharpened.

Second edit: I agree that a good sharpener is important, but if you have $100 to spend today you can wait on sharpener as long as you have a steel to maintain the edge. You will need one, but not today. 

Also I am going to take another look at carbon steel skillets.
A hammock.  Bought my Eno a year ago and I have no idea what I did without it, you can literally post up anywhere and everywhere and it will encourage you to go outside a lot more.
An electric toothbrush
A used instrument
A SSD.

SSDs are a gift from god.
A passport

Although, it depends where in the world you are ... where I am it is less than the equivalent of US$100
Silk pillowcase.

EDIT: I got a silk pillowcase because I have really really long hair (down to my butt) and it keeps it from tangling as badly overnight.
A Cook Book.

Not like a fad celebrity book but a real oldschool family cookbook.

Best one I ever found was at a garage sale and was like 6" thick Ring binder full to the brim with yellow pages some with stains.  It honestly should have been a family treasure and I got it for $20.

Hundreds of family recipes with easy to follow hand writen notes.  I'm sad i never met the grandma that this thing once belonged to.

Edit: Wow thanks for all the up votes.  Its nice to read the comments about other people that have found cool old cook books.

Edit 2:  OMG this is my biggest post ever.  Thank you for the awards and all the votes.  You all made my day :)

Edit 3: Sweet Raptor Jesus...I guess i have a project now to scan and upload this book.

Umm a few people asked so here is my favorite recipe.  These things are amazing and disappear so fast.

As a Canadian it is really upsetting to hear about all the things that can supposedly be had for $100 in other places.

Meat thermometer. No more cutting open meat to see if it’s done, thus leaking juices
A good every day carry pocket knife. I use mine serveral times a day.
Carbon MONOXIDE alarm, please get one.
A slow cooker

A kindle or library card 

A juicer/blender 

A donation to adopt a pet from an animal shelter 

A printer
Rice cooker
A kitchen scale. 

Completely changed my food consumption, since I could easily measure portions. I learned what they actually SHOULD be, not what we in the US act like they are. That + MyFitnessPal (the free version, even!) = Me losing 120lbs over 18 months and developing a much healthier relationship with food and eating. Very simple tools, but great for enacting real, lasting change 👍
A folding wagon.  Getting groceries in the house, camping gear, etc we always have it in the car and you can do 5 trips worth by hand effortlessly.
Tongue Scraper
Books. Knowledge is currency that only increases
Upgraded my box spring, pillow, and purchased a sound machine before lockdown. I've had more solid sleep and am having quite more pleasant days. I live with anxiety and PTSD and am a cannabis user (medically / proper channels). As a father of 3 (4th in route), life is simply compounding with interior place issues. After I upgraded my box spring and pillow I purchased... a sound machine. To be honest, each of these three things with elevate your sleeping and alter you days to come; not to mention the medical.  Each of these things are separately < $100.
prescription contact lens *edit*  didnt realise how many people would want to know where to order.  So far my fastest option is ordering from opticontacts.com   they will only take a week or less.  Lens.me is another option with more exotic brands but they take much longer to arrive as they ship out of dubia.   Neither will ask for prescription from doctor.  You just manually input your rx
A desk for laptop. Seriously using it on bed or somewhere else isn't as great as it's on a desk. Also a comfortable chair.
A rice cooker. My mom always said that having one use appliances is a waste of money and space, and as an adult now I generally agree. No quesadilla makers, donut/cake pop machines, etc. I spent almost ten years of my adult life boiling rice on the stove and often times messing it up. It should be simple but for me it just isn’t. I bought a rice cooker on sale and OH MAN. Life changed. It’s even got a steamer basket so it’s not even technically a one use appliance. Perfect rice every time, and you can set it and forget it until it’s time to eat. Frees up a stove burner, and meals where I cook rice now feel a lot easier. I’m willing to die on this hill.
A collar that you can put ice cubes in to help keep you cool. I do a decent amount of outside and digging jobs and this thing probably saved me from heatstroke. And only 20 bucks
A good set of cookware.   Whether its pots and pans, or a good chef's knife,  every investment I make in my kitchen increases my quality of life.  

Edit: I feel like a few people are being deliberately negative about this. For those of you who honestly dont think that you can buy good cookware for under $100 dollars I encourage you to temper your expectations of what "good" is and check out amazon right now. If you want a full blown set of decent pots and pans there is a ceramic set for around $85 dollars right now. Ceramic cookware is what I started learning to cook on.  Its not perfect but it's a lot better than any teflon or imitation teflon crap out there. If you prefer iron like I do, lodge is a great company and they have a 10 inch iron skillet on sale for $15 dollars right now. Pair that with a decent chef's knife from Mercer $45 (the brand I am currently using) then throw in a dutch oven (looks like you can get one from lodge for 40 dollars and it has a decent rating.) And you're good to go. Those three tools will last for life if taken care of and you can make so much with them. A shepherd's pie, pizza, fresh bread, soups and stews, stir fry..... I mean almost anything.  Pro tip, even if it says preseasoned, look up how to season it anyway. And never use soap on your iron.  Scrub it in the sink under hot water, heat it up on the stove to get the moisture off fast, when it cools off rub it down with any old cooking oils. Just a thin layer with a paper towel will do.
The right shampoo and conditioner. Am dude.

I use this super girly looking stuff called love beauty and planet, and my hair is glorious and I love putting my hands into it. And other people like putting their hands in my hair too. Generally women.

Female marketed products are vastly superior in so many ways, and dudes won't buy it because they're forced into the men's marketed section with bears and wolves and trees that represent shitty college smelling products that are 12-in-1 body/hair/dish/clothes/car wash. 

Hair is hair. Choose the products marketed towards people who give a shit about their hair. Be the beautiful man you were meant to be.

Edit: that is a ton of comments. I'm gonna try to get to them later, but for those who want to know, [this is my shampoo](https://www.lovebeautyandplanet.com/us/en/hair/products/shampoo/sulfate-free-argan-oil-&-lavender-shampoo.html) and [this is my conditioner](https://www.lovebeautyandplanet.com/us/en/hair/products/conditioner/argan-oil-&-lavender-conditioner.html). I used to use Aussie brand conditioner, which did decent things, but felt oily.

Edit2: I have straight hair, but have found r/curlygirl to have great resources. Sulphate free shampoo if where it's at.

Edit3: I'm seeing a TON of people recommend Mane and Tail. I'm sorely tempted to try it after reading all these...

Edit4: Holy shit, apparently there's an 18-in-1 soap. And I thought 12-in-1 was absurd. The kind redditor u/Gilthoniel_Elbereth has put forward https://www.drbronner.com/ for your consideration.

I bought 8 meals (meal preps) for $96 for someone.  It helped them through a hard time and provided hope.  They just got their own place now and can comfortably afford all their meals on their own.

Edit: Damn it I was going to cash in this good karma for something in life, not fake internet point.
A weighted blanket
Paprika recipe app and the corresponding software for your PC. The thing is a miracle. Not only can you download recipes from websites - it pulls the recipe and instructions out and leaves all the chaff ("My grandmother always told me when she made this apple pie that it reminded her of the time that ....") - but you can add ingredients to your grocery list right from the recipe, create meal plans and menus, and share access with another person (they have to buy the app too and use shared login). It's changed the way I meal plan, shop, and cook.
Instant Pot. Seriously, I love my instant pot more than I loved my first slow cooker. It changed summer cooking for me forever.

Edit: So many comments and questions! I get all my recipes and food ideas from youtube channels. Too many to mention here. I bought the zest pot because it was cheaper - I use it mainly for casseroles, chili, rice and pasta dishes. It gets so hot in here that it's nice not to turn on the oven!

A Brita filter water pitcher and reusable bottles. I cut out most drinks aside from water back in October and we were going through 2+ cases a week. It was expensive, heavy, took up way too much space and was such a waste of plastic! I ended up buying a brita pitcher from walmart for about $18. We fill it up 2 or 3 times a day and everyone has their own water bottle now. When quarantine started and no one could find bottled water, but we were good! There were so many positives to buying the brita pitcher that I wish I had bought it years ago!!
A Pso-Rite.

Many people aren't aware of the psoas muscle and its role in tying the body together; a great deal of lower back/glute/hamstring pain stems from a tight psoas, as well as pain in the abdomen, upper back - the list goes on. The psoas is a muscle that runs through the core, tying the hips to the upper abdomen, making it the literal crossroads of the body.

Pso-Rite is expensive for a seemingly easy to recreate piece of plastic, but my god. I've been involved in athletics my entire life, bodybuilding and powerlifting since I was 18 (now 26) and am a big fan of stretching, rolling, using lacrosse balls on my back and feet etc... When my roommate ordered it and it came in he told me to lay on it as low and close to my hips as I could and breathe. Slowly at first I lowered my psoas onto this monster to immediate pain as a lifetime of use, abuse, and outright neglect were all suddenly addressed. Pain, then it got easy, so I went a little further. Pain, then it got easy, so I went a little further. In a matter of maybe 3 minutes I literally felt like a changed man.

I can not recommend it enough. We brought it on vacation and let our friends try it, the reviews were all the same "this sucks it hurts hahah this is shit... oh wow my back doesn't hurt anymore??"

Actual lifesaver.

Edit: clarification on the role of the psoas

A used greenhouse. Growing plants in a greenhouse is one of the most rewarding things ever. You can raise so many amazing plants in there and working in the garden is great for mental health. Probably saved my life. Caring for plants and making them thrives gives me purpose. Great stuff.
This is probably here but a tongue scraper. I brush my teeth often and floss and could still say my mouth felt yucky even a few hours after waking upa and eating nothing sometimes. But a tongue scraper is great. You scrape your tongue when getting ready in the mornings and after you eat it it makes your mouth feel fresher then mouth wash sometimes. Add that into your brushing routine it's like 5 or $6 and it goes a long way for oral hygiene

Yeah my life is boring, so what?

Edit: My wife wants me to add to the list: a food scale, it's invaluable for calorie tracking. You just put your plate on the scale, zero it out, then add each food and write down the weights. That way you can log what you are without any measuring cups etc.

Exfoliation gloves! Theyre easily $3 and they have gotten rid of so much of my acne! I feel like my skin is actually clean when I get out of the shower and theyre pretty thin and easy to dry, unlike loofas and similar products. Probably not very good for sensitive skin but I LOVE THEM

It was completely free for me to pick up a naloxone kit from my local pharmacy. When I called about picking one up, they scheduled a free training 1 on 1 with me so that I knew how to administer it in the event of an overdose. Being in university and having parties around our place made it seem necessary to have one, just in case. (Never had to use it)

Technology has not yet improved to the point where wireless communication is reliable or fast enough to compare to wired. For large downloads and gaming, anyway. Wifi is fine for anything you could do on a phone.
For boob-havers out there, a really good bra that looks great alone and under almost everything, fits really well, and you're not dying to take it off at the end of the day.

They do exist, even for the "busty," like myself. It requires an outlay of cash, but you don't need to pay $100+ for it.

A lot of good comments already. As a dude, I will add: a decent shave kit. 

I use a safety razor from Merkur, the handle is like $40, you can buy cheaper ones. Amazon has a hundred options you can browse. 

Shave cream: my go-to is Truefitt & Hill, it’s $25-$35 for a tub, but it works amazingly well, and the scents they use smell very natural and not like perfumed chemicals. A tub lasts 6+ months, so the cost/shave isn’t crazy. 

A brush: these go from $10 to like a grand if you’re into that. Mine was about $25 and seems to do the trick. The nicer ones have longer, softer bristles, but some prefer coarser bristles to exfoliate a bit. I’m not sure that they really do much good there, but at any rate you can find a perfectly acceptable brush for $25 or so. 

And the kicker: a shaving scuttle, so you get a warm lather. 

If you shop a bit that’s under $100. Turns shaving from a chore into a really enjoyable part of the old morning routine. Blades are like $0.15 each, so if you’re currently using a Mach III type thing at $3/blade, it pays for itself in the long run.
I'm a physician.  Eye doctor specifically.  I will tell you that the longer I work (now 15 years), my standard for the "average" person continues to decline.  Case in point: Thanks to the awful information filtering out there, I had a patient just last week who read that Vitamin D helps you resist a Coronavirus infection.  Well, he had also read that you can get more Vitamin D by getting more sun.  So he wanted to "collect" as much light as possible with his eyes.  As a result, he stared at the sun for a solid 60 seconds and burned holes directly into his retinas permanently reducing his vision with no chance at future improvement.
One guy I met said that English is the true language of God because The Bible is written in English.
I used to work in travel and the amount of people that did not understand the following was staggering:

\- You cannot take a 3-7 round trip night cruise from Miami to Australia (and no, your friend did not just book this)

\- No, there are in fact no ocean bound cruises leaving from Arizona

\- You cannot take a cruise from Miami to Hawaii and back in 7-10 days

\-No, the airport is closed due to hurricane/flood/ice and you cannot demand a flight on a different carrier out of the same airport in the next hour (also no, you did not just see someone book this)

\- Yes, it is a shorter flight for your friends from East Coast US to the Caribbean than you in Europe and no, nobody can change that

\- Yes, I will need your DD 214 to confirm a military rate, no your word you "were in a covert unit" will not suffice and no, I am not disrespecting the military because I cannot simply take your word for it

\-Yes, if a passport/Visa/Travel Vaccinations are needed for you to travel you will need it and no a manager cannot override this as it is a government requirement

I have been doing this for 6 years and no your friend's neighbor's hairdresser's roommate's cousin's mailman does not know more about this than I do.
Oof. Good one. Okay; so my favorite was a guy who was planning his honeymoon but he didn't have a lot of money. He was bummed about the cost of air travel. A friend suggested a train ride m8ght be cheaper. He became frustrated after a few days of trying and complained that he couldn't find any trains going to...

Hawai'i

It still didn't sink in because he had seen pictures of trains in Hawai'i. He couldn't grasp that they were shipped there. It got even more surreal after that.

Old boss had a morning routine of walking around the office with a bucket.  He was watering all of the plastic flowers.
Friend of mine showered in cold water for a year cause he never thought of turning the other tap to see what it would do.
I used to work for a chatbot app. Our app would text our users every morning with a greeting in a different language, i.e. Hola, Bonjour etc. One day we got blown up by a user saying their account was hacked. She said, "my name is Kim Smith, not Kim Konnichiwa, someone's hacked my account!" When we explained that our service has been clearly saying hello to her in other languages every day and that konnichiwa is hello in Japanese and her account was fine, she went on a racist rant and said Disney was behind the destruction of America. Yep.
I just had a customer yell at me for putting their eggs in a separate bag, saying they don’t want all those bags and the paper ones always rip. Before putting it in the bag and throwing a pound of flour on top...

It was somewhat satisfying seeing their face as we heard the cracks, until I realized I’m the one who needed to clean it up. Oh also she complained that we hadn’t warned her about the fragility of eggs.
At the DMV.    I went to renew my license.   I was waiting in a room with the computers that people use to take the written portion.   The clerk sat a man down looked him in the eyes and said "if you pull your phone out it's an automatic fail."   The window licker says "aight" while pulling out his phone and immediately failing.

About half the calls I take on a daily basis.

People call 911 to ask whether Walmart is open. To report that they didn't get enough mayo on their burger. To complain that cleanup at a fatality wreck is taking too long. All sorts of silly, out of touch shit.

Granted, there is probably some level of mental illness and/or substance abuse present in those calls. But still.
Getting a misdialed call from a random person who gets mad at you because you’re not the one he/she was looking for. Happens with me several times a year.
I once owned a SmartCar and some stranger approached me at a gas station about why I didn't have a "Slow vehicle" sign in the back of it "[...] since all moped-cars must have that!". 

I tried explaining that it was a real car - just a bit smaller - but he didn't take it. According to him I was driving illegally and he was surprised the police hadn't stopped me yet on the highway.
My Dad is a pesticide investigator for the state and heard this on a complaint: 

"I set out all these bird feeders and bird baths but not one bird comes to my yard. I bet it is all those pesticides that crop duster is laying down in the field" -- local school board member, as they were standing in her 5 acre yard with 20 or more cats running around.
I used to manage a retail store that sold teen clothing, so as expected, I primarily had teens working for me. 

One employee came to the back room while I was on break and asked what I was eating. Somehow the topic turned to how I should’ve brought chicken for lunch because she wanted chicken. I told her I was vegetarian and therefore don’t eat meat....

She tells me chicken is NOT meat. It’s “poultry”, and vegetarians can eat poultry??? She said at the grocery store the aisles list “meat” and “poultry” separately so they’re *obviously* different. We argued for a couple of minutes before I finally told her to go back to the sales floor.  She didn’t last at the job long, but DAMN.
At the start of working from home due to Covid, I had a few users submit tickets for "connectivity issues".  These tickets got through 2 lines of support before landing in my queue.  

Turns out that the corporate WiFi doesn't follow you home and you need home internet in order to connect to the VPN.

I worked in retail for a few years and it taught me that many people are either incapable or unwilling to read. I have had people walk up to me to ask me how much something is, only for the price tag to be featured prominently on the item. 

"It's $9.99, ma'am."

"HOW DID YOU KNOW?"

"It says so on the price tag, ma'am."
I worked with a lady who was remarking on how a friend of hers had lost a bunch of weight. She pondered, "I wonder how many diet cokes she had to drink to do that."

EDIT: Same lady was convinced beyond repair that when you sneeze, the air ONLY comes out of your nose. There was no convincing her otherwise.

A woman I used to work with who insisted that any animal could reproduce with any other animal. She believed that sperm from any animal was the same and that DNA was irrelevant.

She believed this because she once saw some sickly, possibly deformed puppies and decided that they must have been half dog and half rat.
A former coworker was talking about how she wanted to go back to school to get her masters' degree because she only had a "bachelorette" degree and wanted more job opportunities. I said, "Do you mean a bachelor's degree?" She INSISTED it was pronounced bachelorette when it was given to a woman. Then she led me back to her office and pointed at her diploma, to the word Baccalaureate, and said, "SEE?! Bachelorette!"
I had a bald man return a hairdryer because it burnt his head.....

When I was in high school, we were reading a short story about what would have happened if the Japanese attacked us back with nuclear weapons after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A girl in my class raised her hand and said something along the lines of “why does this matter? None of it is real any way”. The teacher had to ask her to clarify, but this girl thought WWII and the bombing of Japan were just from a movie and didn’t actually happen.

The best part is: the girl was half Japanese

Edit: wow thank you for al of the upvotes! I have a ton more stories about this girl, so maybe I’ll post some on a different subreddit soon!
Worked at a larger grocery chain whose deli used scales that would show you digitally the weight so 1 & 1/2 lbs would show 1.50 lbs on the scale etc ... 
The person I worked (F35yrs) had to ask me to come over and tell her how much she had sliced everytime she assisted someone for over 4 months. She had passed the written and verbal test they give to verify that you should be able to do this. She didnt seem to have problems reading any other signs or numbers so I dont think dyslexia played a part but man it was so frustrating trying to do my job and hers.
I work in IT.  I once had a lady call me from home because she couldn't get connected to her VPN.  I asked her if she was connected to her home wireless network.  She replied saying that she did not have home wireless.  I then asked how she was connecting to the internet.  Her reply was "I'm using the cell tower.  I can see it from my house.". While this is technically possible with a hotspot or cellular card in your PC, this isn't what she meant.  She thought she could get internet service via WiFi from the cell tower.

On 9/11 the General Manager called his daughter who was attending ASU to wake her up and make sure she saw what was going on.  The customer service MANAGER said.. "It won't be on her TV yet, Arizona is 2 hours behind us".........
I work at a restaurant

We were low on tomatoes for our tomato soup, so one person grabbed potatoes to see if we could use those instead.
I worked at Little Caesars and we were proofing the dough for pizza. My boss said (at 7pm) that the dough needed to rise for 12 hours, and took out her calculator to do the math. So I said ummm that's gonna be 7am. Then she said the dough will expire in 48 hours and started doing the math again. I told her it would expire two days from now, and she said "that's kinda weird how that works out huh?" 

I quit shortly after that.
Not necessarily the exact thing you're looking for, but when I was in High School I once had a friend come up to me bragging about his PSAT. I recognized immediately that he got a pretty poor score. When I mentioned to him that I didn't think it was a very good score, he confidently proclaimed: 

"But it says I'm smarter than 15% of Juniors, and I'm only a sophomore!"

To which I rebutted: 

"Yeah, but imagine the DUMBEST 15% of people. That's not very good."
I had a friend once who truly believed that magicians like Chriss Angel and David Blaine had some kind of magical power or telekinesis, something along those lines. While watching one of those magicians on tv performing on the street he argued 

"how could this be fake? Look at all those people. Cant fake all that. Has to be some kind of power or magic."

 I would then have to ask do you realize that movies are fake? They fake entire universes, planets, cities, war, etc. He didn't get what I was getting at.
I once was working at a Renaissance Festival in South Florida. I was just barely 21- had gone down there for the winter to help out a musician friend, and was living a very frugal lifestyle. I don't think I even had a debit card at that point, and my cell phone was pay-per-text at like $.10 a message. 

So anyway- I would totally get paid for booth-sitting for some artists after the weekend- but by Friday, I was pretty broke. I had about $7 in gold dollar coins- because that's what I liked to keep on me at faire to give out as change. I had the remains of the $20 I'd taken in coins, and other than that, I didnt have any other cash. 

We had a kid's day at faire- where schools bring kids on school trips, and so I needed to grab some food and get back to Deerfield Beach Park. So fully dressed in Renaissance garb, I ran into the Taco Bell.  I figured my cash would go the farthest there.  I ordered my food, and when I went to pay, the girl behind the counter LAUGHS and goes; 

"Uh- no. I need REAL money." 

I looked at her, confused. "These ARE real money, they are gold Sacajawea dollars..." 

"Yeah, we only take US cash here. I need actual money to pay for the food." 

Now the line behind me is getting antsy- but the girl at the register is getting really bitchy and I'm like - what the fuck do you do when a business WONT take your payment. It wasn't like I was trying to pay in nickels. I had $4.-- worth of food and tried giving her $5 in coins. 

I'm like, "This is all I've got on me... I don't know what to tell you- but it IS legal US tender- see right here?" And I'm trying to show her the coins- and shes yelling like im trying to pay her in monopoly money. 

The guy behind me was like "yeah, those are real coins"- but I don't think he wanted her ire turned towards him- so he wasn't very forceful. I asked if she could get a manager and she was like, "I ain't gonna waste his time with this bullshit. You either pay in real money, or leave" and she's grabbed my bag of food so I can't go anywhere. 

I take out my wallet- remembering the two lucky $2 bills I had carried for YEARS- folded up in the back pocket. I unfolded those- and she takes one look at the $2 bills... And I'm sure you can predict what happened. She BLEW UP. 

Next thing I know- she's screaming for the staff to call the cops and telling ME not to go anywhere because I'm trying to rip her off and pass off all this "fake money" and she "gon see my ass to jail!" - meanwhile, I'm hungry, tired, and now very very irritated- and that's when a cop car pulls up. 

They weren't responding to the call- I don't even know if the store HAD called. I was ready to walk out, nearly in tears - when the two cops come in and all eyes turn to them. There's about ten people now in line behind me- and everyone turns to look at the cops who very clearly have a "wtf is going on- I just stopped to get food" look on thier faces. 

That's when the obnoxious register girl, and two co-workers she called over- start waving my money around (that was the best part- she took my money and was refusing to give it back OR to give me my food)- and the cops go to the counter to figure out what she's freaking out over. At this point, the manager heard the commotion and joins the two guys and the register girl. The three teenager employees are all going on and on about "the girl in the costume trying to give them fake money tryna rip them off"- and the cops VERY quickly put an end to that. 

The one cop holds up the two $2 bills, and my gold dollar coins- and he tells the staff that BOTH are- indeed- actual REAL money. The girl is still protesting- saying"yeah but it's not America money and we only take America money."- when the manager finally realized what happened and apologized- telling the teenagers - who look to be completely in disbelief - that yes, the coins AND bills are BOTH really, United States money. 

The manager offers to personally remake my meal- and the cops as well - apologizing for everything. I'm REALLY late at this point, and I didn't really trust them to make my food, even if the manager was being really nice- but the cop said"I tell you what- I'll come back and get your info while you make our food. How about that?" - so he accompanied the manager back white he washed his hands and made our food. 

The other cop gave me my money back, and took my info. As I was FINALLY leaving with my food- the guy behind me jokes with the cop "I think I'm going to pay with a handful of half-dollars I've got in my car. What do you think?" 

I was SO floored that anyone could be SO ignorant... And not just ignorant, but completely and utterly unwilling to realize or to recognize that they had made a mistake and were wrong. All she did was double down- insisting we were ALL wrong and I was just a thief. 

SO FRUSTRATING!
Infantryman was told to trim the hedges. So he lifted the lawnmower. His buddy started it. As a brand new medic, I spent about 6 hours pulling fingermeat from the hedges.

Edit: thanks for the award.

Update: Sorry, I'm a Redderp and on a phone. For clarification, it was early 2004 after OIF1 in the 82nd. 

I was a PFC with only a year and a half in service. We bandaged him, then used tourniquet (temporarily). Senior medics took him to the ER. I was field sanitation qualified, so I was left in charge of cleanup. 6 hours was excessive, but after we pulled most the meat and bone out, we had to hose down the hedges, the ground, the grass he bled in, the ground/floor outside and inside where he left a decent amount of blood had to be rinsed and sterilized. The mower had to be rinsed and cleaned. It had some damage from the drop. The private that started the mower had to be smoked by his nco. We finished in about 4 hours of actual work with 2 hours of fucking off mixed in, cause the sham shield is the real deal.
At a work Christmas party in a Mexican restaurant, an Irish colleague was trying to argue the pronunciation of "jalapenos" with the Mexican waitress was "ja-la-pen-nose". He wasn't joking and got so upset with her "taking the piss out of him" that he made a scene and we almost got thrown out.
In grade ten, we had a science test, and the teacher gave one point for putting a date on the paper, and one point for your name on the paper....and then there were 98 points for the rest of the test.  A guy sitting in front of me got 0.5/100....didnt write the date and only wrote his first name....

I’m learning Spanish and I once told him I was reading this Don Quijote book. I complained about how difficult it was because it was written in 1605.

I was doing a COVID decon of a medical supply warehouse that had a confirmed positive employee not too long ago and while my team was inside doing our thing, the floor/shift manager was following us around without a mask or gloves or really any of the proper PPE except for a high-vis vest and steel toe boots..... I had to tell her to leave the room I was fogging with virucide....

Edit: meanwhile, we were wearing full level C hazmat suits with P100 combo cartridge respirators and all seams taped up.

I once got into an argument with someone over my own name. There are two pronunciations German and English. And they just couldnt accept the fact that I use the english pronunciation despite the fact that we were speaking English and it's what I've used my whole life but nope I was lying to mess with them.
Knew a kid who drank bleach to prove it wouldn’t kill you.

A week later he showed up at school after taking a shot. 

He said he “proved his point” when the teacher asked why he was bragging about it. 

Mr Hawk just said “But you cannot argue that without that medical treatment you’d have died though- you even said you have stomach damage and a burn esophagus yourself”.

This kid was bragging about that. He was not mentally disabled or otherwise. He was just that kind of idiot.

Edit: Thank you all, who’d have thought my most upvoted comment would be about some kid I knew drinking literal bleach. RIP my inbox

That people act supprised at the total death count going up. Its always going to go up. If it was going down that's an entirely different pandemic altogether.
My ex had a student, one who occasionally misspelled his own name, turn in a very well written essay that just so happened to be clearly printed off the internet, included the URL at the bottom. He gave the kid a zero. Kid's grandmother came in to the office completely distraught because she KNOWS her grandson wrote that essay. Her proof? He said he wrote it. When it was shown to her on the internet, she insisted that he must have written it and put it on that website himself. Thank goodness the principal was a good one and let her know she didn't buy that for a minute. 

Also, when I was a teller, I asked a man for ID. He showed me his personalized belt buckle. When I said that wasn't enough, he offered to go get his sister from the car; she could tell me who he was. He didn't understand why neither of those would work. 'Who else would wear a belt buckle with my name on it? Why would my sister lie to you? She doesn't want any money."
Had someone argue with me because they where sure that the cavemen were before the dinosaurs and that it is impossible that dinosaurs even existed, she considers mammoth and sabertooth to be dinosaur.
Was sitting next to a girl who was notoriously dumb at our school. Thought people were being too hard on her until she straight up asked Google “Who invented water?”

The average voter. Churchill said it best: "The best argument against Democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter."
I have a fraternal male twin (I am female) and in high school I had a girl ask if we were identical, I said “no he’s a dude” and she said “no I mean genetically are you identical?” And I just stared at her wondering if she skipped all of our science classes to not know the answer...

On the man show they set up a booth on some pier (I think Santa Monica) and were getting women to sign up to end womans suffrage. Tons of women were signing. Obviously being the man show this was a joke on women but the reality is the amount of people in general who do not know suffrage is the right to vote and not some sort of suffering is far too high.
Stupid: I work for a company that has a bonus pay system, which is based on survey responses.

Stupider: I got a survey that marked everything a 1-2 (out of 10, 10 being highest), as in I got **bombed** on this survey. But the survey includes an open comment field, where the customer's comment stated that the service was fantastic and everything was great. (Clearly this indicates that they simply did the survey "upside down".)

Stupidest: My district manager refused to invalidate the survey response. I didn't get my bonus for the quarter.
I work with this one guy. He asked me about a daily deadline that had to be met, one that I designed. I told him the deadline time. He then proceeded to argue with me for fifteen minutes about how I was wrong and that it was actually an hour before that. I didn’t even know what to tell him.
A man I worked with, 23-25 years old was absolutely POSITIVE that the TechRax video where he drills a hole in a iPhone 7or8 (which ever was the first without a 3.5mm jack) to make the headphone jack was 100% real, AND THEY DID IT TO HIDE IT FROM CUSTOMERS AND THIS WAS A HACK TO FIND IT. 

I'm a techie, I built another person's computer, and he argued with me for 25-45 mins about this, I pulled up diagrams, explained he was drilling into the battery, and even named TechRax when he couldn't name the video maker (he saw it on Instagram) and I knew his entire channel was ruining tech I showed him, and I told him if he could do it i'd pay for the iPhone in full if it works, and he was literally shopping around for it, when another one of my coworkers who was watching this argument and SIDING WITH THIS MAN DISPITE HIM KNOWING I'M A TECHIE AND TRUSTING ME TO BUILD HIS $2K PC said "oh my brother just got that phone" and they called him and he said "nah that's fake" AND THAT WAS IT, THEY BELIEVED HIM, I SHOWED THEM SCHEMATICS AND BREAKDOWNS OF THE PHONE AND THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, BUT "nah it's fake" WAS? 

This man also had to get a ride home when his car steering wheel wouldn't move because it was locked as most cars do and he played with it for an hour and was unable to unlock his wheel. 

He's a fucking mouth breather.

I had a patient overdose on heroin the other day.  We got to the house and a friend at the house stated she poured milk down his throat thinking it reversed the effects of heroin.
I was knocking doors in Memphis, Tennessee. Not the nice part either, I told one of the residents I talked to I was from Connecticut. She said, "oh my when did we get a 51st state?" I then told people from that point on I was from the Big apple.
I was working in a gas station in a ski town during off season. Needed the $$. This town was at the South Gate Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. A woman came in and slapped a dollar on the counter. In the most Karen way she said: “I want change for a dollar. That’s FOUR QUARTERS!”  “You’re kidding. I am from Canada and our dollars have FIVE quarters. Thank you for sharing!”  She lit up with pride, took her change and left.
When Italy was Europe’s coronavirus epicentre, my supermarket sold out of all forms of canned tomatoes...except the ones with “Italian” on the can.
I just finished tutoring two intro to comp sci courses. Lesson 1 in about defining variables. Naturally, there's people that didn't know how to do that by the final. People learn at different rates. I get that, but how did you not learn lesson 1 after 15 weeks, 20ish homework assignments, 7 quizzes, and 2 previous exams?

One example: we have the plastic shield up at the desk at the door for the whole covid thing for protection when checking receipts. People tried reaching around it so we had to write “receipts here” with arrows so they’d know where to put it. Now they try putting it THROUGH the plastic like it’s a window

I used to teach university students. The kids were 20-21 years old and in the second year of either molecular biology, biochemistry, or microbiology. When I handed back assignments I told them that they were alphabetized by last name. Every week 90% of them would flip through the stack one-by-one whether their name was Atkins or Zanzibar. They didn't listen, they didn't learn.

Another time I walked past two girls talking (in high school valley girl voices)  and one said it's amazing the Olympics are going on this year, they only happen once every one hundred years. The others response was omg yea.
When I was a sophomore in high school, a classmate asked to borrow a pen, and I lent him one of mine that had the Eiffel Tower on it. He asked where the building was from, and I said Paris. He gave me a confused look and asked where Paris was. Was it further away than Chicago? Now it was my turn to be confused. We were in high school, how the hell did he not know Paris was in France? But whatever, maybe he's not the brightest. So I inform him that Paris is in France. 

But he still looks utterly confused. I assume he misheard me, so I started explaining it. *"France, you know, like, FRANCE. From history class? World War II, Napoleon... that France." He said he was bad at history, and had never heard of France before. He then asked me if it was another state, or was it like a region of our state.

Utterly baffled at this point, I tried to explain that it was another country entirely, and it was in Europe. Exasperated, I remember saying "You know, *Europe*?! That other continent?" He still looked confused, so I added "**THE LAND ACROSS THE OCEAN!**"

Finally, there is recognition on his face. He tells me he heard of oceans before, he thinks he understands now.

I remind you that this encounter, with a student who didn't know what Europe was, took place *in high school*.
I had a 16-year-old new start ask me at work "Was the world black and white before they invented colour TV's?"

"No! I'm on my internet! I just bough this internet computer thing, spent like 5 hours putting it together and it don't work!"

Ok, the thing you are using to move the cursor? That's the mouse. Make sure its on a clean, smooth surface

"Wait, that's not a pedal? I'm supposed to use that with my hand?"
I work for a cupcake shop that takes deliveries and this just happened today. A lady calls, pissed, saying the cupcakes she ordered for her brother never arrived. This is concerning because all the morning deliveries had been made! I frantically start texting the delivery driver about what happened, in case it went to the wrong place, but she swears up and down it was delivered with no problems to the recipient’s assistant since he wasn’t in the office at the time. I call the lady back, explaining this, and she tells me “oh that makes sense. He hadn’t asked if anything had come for him, so I’ll tell him to ask for his cupcakes.” Love when people jump to the worst conclusions about our staff instead of just telling their loved ones they have a delivery and should look around for it for more than two seconds.
There's one I have that stands out for this question. I was at my job at the time, a buffet place that has decent prices considering they serve steak on the bar and you can get a lot of expensive product for about $17US per adult, and had a younger couple come in during the weekend. For context, the prices at this place were a bit higher during the weekend because that was when they would pull out the bigger stuff, like prime rib. They ask for two dinners and two drinks, so I punch them into the register, and tell them the price - after tax, maybe $35US or so. They look a little apprehensive at the price, and ask if they can think about it. Well, there was no one else in the line waiting to eat in, so I say "Sure! Just let me get this gentleman's to go order while you do." They're fine with it.

So I ring in the guy's to go order, and since the to go prices were determined by weight, if you got a reasonable amount of food for a human being getting to go was usually cheaper than dining in. So they hear that this guy pays maybe... $10US? Or something in that area, and say "Well, we'll just do a to go order because it's cheaper!"

So I tell them the process for getting a to go order in this place, and they go and start filling their containers. A while later, not exactly sure how much later off of the top of my head, they come back with like 5 or 6 fucking containers of food. All to go. I get them rung in and the price is at least $15-$20US more than if they had just paid and eaten in, and they came back the next day to get MORE. They paid at least $15US more every time they came in than they would if they had just eaten in and paid that fucking price for all the food! They really should've done some damn math.
Here's my story. I apologize for the length, but it's worth it. Trust me...

Years ago, I had to apply for some kind of government program. Can't remember what. Probably something to do with my kids' health insurance. But that's immaterial.

I had just closed the doors on a dismally failed business, which was why I was applying for the program. They had me fax all of my earnings and bookkeeping paperwork... most of which had zeroes or negative numbers on them. The person on the phone was looking at the papers I faxed them the day before.

Finally, the guy said, "Sir, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you to our financial expert." He used that word..."Financial Expert." (Remember that. It's important.)

After a brief 40-or-so minutes on hold, I was talking to the "Financial Expert." We went back and forth for a while and she was obviously confused AF. (My paperwork was as simple and basic as you can imagine, mind you. Like first-lesson-in-high-school-accounting simple) She sighed with frustration. Oh, really? YOU'RE frustrated, bitch?

Here it comes:

After 20 minutes or so, she asks me, "What does 'Sooo' mean?"

I gets confused. I look everywhere. The word "Sooo" is nowhere on the papers. I say, "Ma'am, you're looking at an exact copy of the papers I'm holding in front of me. The word 'Sooo' isn't on any of these pages."

Well, to make a long story slightly less long, it took me another 10 minutes or so to realize that she, a supposed government agency "FINANCIAL EXPERT," was mistaking the numeric designation for no money --- "$0.00" --- for the word "Sooo."

A Financial fucking Expert... didn't... know... what "$0.00"... meant. Financial expert.

That was the moment I realized that George Carlin was being generous when he said, "Picture how stupid the average person is, then realize that half of them are even stupider than that."

American voters were surveyed as to which they liked better, Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

The ACA had drastically higher support.

They are the same fucking thing.
I used to work customer service for a bank, and that job seriously showed me how very very stupid people are. A very common one were the people who would call in with a question about their account, but they'd refuse to give me literally any information about who they were (date of birth, numbers on the back of their card, address, etc) because I could be a scammer. Like ok Karen, YOU called US. I can't access your account unless I know who you are, so what do you expect me to do? 

Or the people who would call our bank about their account, despite not belonging to our bank and never having belonged to our bank, to ask a question about their account (which is with another bank). Those calls were awful, because I'd spend ages trying to find their account and they'd be getting angry like I'M the incompetent one. Then they'd find their card somewhere while they're on the call and... surprise! It's with another bank. Like how the hell do you even make that mistake?
In the 80's, A&W attempted to compete with McDonald's "quarter-pounder" burger by selling a "third-pounder" for the same price. The operation failed tremendously, with virtually no one buying the burger. When they surveyed customers for an explanation, the majority of customers responded that they "didn't want to pay the same price for less meat."

Their customers genuinely believed that one third was less than one fourth and refused to try the new A&W burger because of it.

"We actually only have large."

"Oh okay. Let me get a small then."

"We.... We only sell large pizzas..."

Edit: Our large is the smallest we have. We have large, extra large, and 26". We call it large for marketing purposes.

The Clown Epidemic of '16
Men’s styles - patterned short sleeved button down shirts, flannel shirts, beards, high and tight haircuts

Women’s styles - yoga pants, athleisure, jumpsuits/rompers, “Coachella” attire (don’t know how else to describe this but it’s a distinct look)

Music - country, mumble hip hop, bad repetitive pop, EDM and festivals

Tech - automation, social media, data, mobile

Social networks and how everyone thought It was a good idea to keep track of everyone in their life.

Kids in 10 years will be like “so you met this guy at the pub and... added him into your social network? Didn’t that give him access to ALL your social details?”

Privacy will become the biggest thing ever, and loose social media connections will become the exact thing NOT to do.

You know when you watch documentaries now about kids in the 80s hitchhiking or stepping into a serial killers van because they said they had puppies in there, and you scream at the tv like WHAT ARE YOU DOING YOU IDIOT???

The death of traditional media.

Printed newspapers and periodicals, broadcast television and radio are fading. And while digital music way predates the 2010s, it took until this decade for pop stars to stop "selling" albums. They aren't tallying CD sales anymore, they're counting unique streams.
People are gonna reminisce about how good the 2010's were. They may not seem good now, but just wait to see what the 20's have in store for you.

Obama/Trump
From a video game standpoint, this is the decade of the indie explosion, esports, battle royales and micro transactions.

From a cinematic standpoint, this is the age of superheroes. Comic book movies dominated in the last decade and they are not going anywhere anytime soon.
From a design/aesthetic standpoint:

* Minimalism/Flat design, mostly due to the rise of tablets and browsing the internet on mobile devices. Clean lines, simple colors like black, white and grey.

* TV commercials: Early 2010s ads are backed by upbeat xylophone/triangle/whistling/hand clapping music, or people breakdancing or doing “the worm” to obnoxious dubstep music. The late 2010s have vivid colors and imagery, vaporwave-style aesthetics, and loud over-the-top spokespeople talking fast in the middle of the screen (think “Captain Obvious” from the Hotels.com commercials or Terry Crews from the Old Spice commercials)

* Entering a new golden age of automotive design. Almost every new car from the decade is elaborately styled. Car interiors with angular, intricate dashboards (like the Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox or Hyundai Santa Fe). This might end in the 2020s as crash safety technology requires more new cars to look the same, and car interiors will replace dashboards and gauges with touch screens (Thanks, Tesla).

* A move away from chain restaurants and the rise of food trucks and locally-owned restaurants that all feature string lighting, outdoor tables with giant Jenga blocks, Edison bulbs, and a craft beer selection written on a chalkboard.

* All houses are painted in that “griege” color and have all-white kitchens with that same white subway tile backsplash. There is probably a barn door, shiplap accent wall, and a fiddle-leaf fig inside.
Depression and memes. But really I think mental health will be one of the biggest problems going forward and this is going to be known as the times when it emerged as a problem.
The incredible rise of misinformation and irresponsible kneejerk reaction choices on very serious topics.

They solved ADD overnight while boosting our economy to levels unseen since the POG craze of the 90’s! 

don’t ever forget this
The promulgation of the internet. The 2010s saw the popularity of smartphones which has revolutionized many industries. The internet is way more a force now than it was pre 2010. Network TV isn't a thing because of the internet. Brick and mortar stores are dying because of the internet.
Shitty Geico and Progressive commercials.
The beginning of automation. A ton of jobs are already automated but this decade was probably the true beginning, from testing driverless cars and drones to entire service industries being replaced by self service counters. This will truly be the beginning of automated industries.
Knowing that global warming is going to hit us hard and doing virtually nothing about it globally
I've only been alive 2 decades, so take what I have to say with a grain of salt. But I think this will be remembered as the decade when the physical world was overtaken the online world. 

Dating is online. Classes are online. News is online, and it's about what politicians said online. Presidential campaigns are internet memes. Print media and physical music are disappearing. Our jobs are being taken by AI. The jobs we have left are done on computers. 

The cloud knows more data about us than we do. You have to have an email to sign up for anything, and apps are constantly trying to wring more digital data out of us.

I know this sounds conspiratorial. Personally I'm not against it, I think we just have to find a balance.

I always think about this. The 80s were defined by optimistic decadence and a neon future, the 90s were a hangover from the 80s, dominated by grunge and grit, lead by the freedom fighters and suburban rebel rock.

The 00s is when the effects of globalism really started to take hold ... ultimately I feel like the 00s were a positive time, when we experienced a brief utopia of man and machine which led to a lot of realization, inspiration and evolution. However, the (r)evolution was somewhat organic, and even though we experienced an economic downturn, the future looked bright.

The 10s were plastic. We let a reality TV show host become president. We realized the dystopian future that we read about in books and saw in movies. The boundaries of what is real have been stretched and shattered. The rich are living in a separate reality in their high rises and the poor are killing each other in the streets. It has been a time of dark hedonism, which I think will result in a following period of enlightenment and return to nature.
I think this decade will be remembered for a few big things (at least in the US):

* Millennials. The name of the game this decade. Millennials were at the center of almost every major cultural conversation. From social media and technology to jobs and the economy. Hipsters and smart phones and gaming systems and trends and Facebook and Instagram, etc, etc. Millennials had the biggest cultural impact of this decade. 

* Obama/Trump. Obama was elected last decade, but most of his term was this decade. He got Bin Laden, passed healthcare, and triggered a whole bunch of people just because he was Black. Then Trump really popped up in 2015 for his presidential run (was it really that long ago?) and he's been at the forefront of news ever since. 

* Superhero everything. 20 MCU movies have been released this decade. Then there are the other Spider-Man movies, the DC universe movies (Nolan's and Snyder's), as well as countless other movies and shows. Last decade was zombies, this decade is superheroes.

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.
Cannabis legalization movement...  As a graduate during the economic recession, its the only real positive thing I remember in the past decade.  And the crazy American cultural swing from Obama to Trump.  Its the decade when all governments became a joke...
"I work at a hospital, and go to covid floors on a regular basis. It's more for your benefit than mine." It's true and unsurprisingly shuts up even the most ignorant of people.
I'm a covid icu nurse. I find it funny when people say something like this. Then when I inform them of where I work, I suddenly have at least six feet all around me and people are staring at me in shock or horror. But, you do what you can to keep yourself and your family safe. Dont worry about the others.if they don't pay your bills or snuggle up to you at night, why does their opinion matter anyway?
If anyone ever said anything to me, I would probably just laugh at them. My mask even says the immune disease I have on it, just for that one purpose...to keep people for giving me shit. Saying that, I mostly stay home, I do no contact shopping, and doctor's appointments. I'll not let anyone make me feel badly for protecting myself or my family. 

We just lost my Aunt today to COVID complications, so I would probably ask if they have lost anyone to Covid and if they said no, I'd tell them to shove their mocking up their...
I live in rural Indiana and hardly anyone wears a mask or distances. I go about life the same way I always do honestly, stay in as much as possible and when I'm out I pretend they don't exist. When I do get snide comments I just ignore them and carry on with my day.
A friend of mine kept saying it was a hoax, overblown, no worse than the flu etc. He was hospitalized for a week and been out for almost a month now and still can’t breathe right
I’ve done Thanksgiving for years. This year, it’s my husband, me and my elderly mother minus the 8-10 more we usually have. Somehow, I’m the overreacting asshole for keeping my mother safe. Hoping it will make them appreciate once we can go back to me cooking like a crazy person, but I’m not holding my breath.
I embraced a long time ago that everyone else thinks I make no sense.
Keep on doing it. If anyone asks, just respond with "Listen, I don't tell you you how to protect you and your family, don't start telling me how to protect mine". Most of the covidiots I run in to are against it because they don't like being told how to live their lives, so use that mind set against them
I walked out of work. 
As the HR manager I had no choice. I was just so frustrated that my boss wasn't taking it seriously.
This happened in April when we (South Africa) went into lockdown. He wouldn't provide masks, gloves, barriers etc for the factory. Then insisted all the office workers stay. So I walked out. I carried on working from home & completed all my tasks. Got disciplinary action but he couldn't fire me.

Months later things have finally changed. But I've found another job. If that's how he treats staff's lives, he'll do it again. Tomorrow is my last day.

So, protect yourself & your family first. And ignore the idiots. This pandemic is real.
In public I wear big over ear headphones. 

At work when people say insane conspiracy shit I laugh at them. It’s the only response I’ve found that shuts them up. I tried to explain and discuss the facts but once I realized that was never going to work I just started laughing at them. And I mean *at* them.
I just happily agree.  "Yup, I'm paranoid.  Yup, we are all crazy.  No, we still won't get together with you, because I'm so paranoid and crazy.  And yes, I still wear a mask every time I go outside, because I'm so paranoid and crazy."

The top priority in a pandemic is to survive it without getting sick.  Period, full stop, end of story.  Let everyone else think what they think.  Just do what you need to do to keep yourself safe.
I've had a fair share of arguments and have been branded the "crazy, overprotective new mom" by my husband's family because I've taken this pandemic seriously as absolutely possible since the beginning. Yes, I'm especially adamant when it comes to my 5 month old, but I'd be just as serious if I didn't have a baby around for this. 

I cope by keeping my foot firmly down and mostly ignoring the snide comments that come my way. I don't need to justify my actions and decisions, so if you can't comply with them, then don't bother me with your bitching. There's a few loved ones that are much more "relaxed," but they've been respectful of my decisions.
Mostly quesadillas
I wear a hat in winter to keep my head warm. I treat a mask the same way. I don’t care what other people think, and I have become so used to having a mask with me I feel uncomfortable without one.
Just keep doing your thing and keep yourself safe. The others will have to find out the hard way if they get it. This should have never been politicized in the first place.
Heard this from someone else- just say “apparently I care about you more than you care about me.”
It's like driving a car, and the other drivers aren't being safe. You keep your distance, try to stay positive, and try to understand that everyone has different levels of risk tolerance, understanding of the rules, etc. and that the best you can do is keep yourself safe and not contribute to the problem. Getting upset, or wanting to personally intervene to police other people's behavior is perfectly understandable, but it probably won't help, it might even make things worse.
I get upset, but you only get to pick so many battles in life. I work in a pharmacy and I’m pretty fascinated by COVID, so I’m constantly reading about the virus, treatment protocols, vaccines, etc. 

When I smell people trying to be shitty about the whole thing, I usually rattle off some of the more interesting things I’ve read lately and they usually reply with some stupid conspiracy theory and I just tell them I can’t go down that rabbit hole with them. 

Also, while I have the platform, hey, you fucking idiots, the government is pouring billions into facial recognition, a mask is your best defense against COVID and restoring your privacy! Fuckin’ idiots....
I remember seeing a tweet that read something like this (paraphrasing)

“Even if the pandemic turns out not to be a big deal, and we really are all ‘Sheep’ I’ll be content knowing I was a sheep by caring for other people and wearing a mask”

This stuck with me and makes me glad to follow guidelines
I cope by not having to go to the ER because of covid symptoms
Well, one factor is that I am “crazy” - like, DSM III levels of neurological distinctiveness, chronic & severe.

To me, this is just an update: the paranoid anxiety I have always experienced... is real, now. Most people aren’t used to their reality upending suddenly, so it upsets them more.

To me, this is the world swimming in the waters I grew up in - constant fear, uncertainty; no reliable guidance or expertise that is consistent or trustworthy; people ignoring what they don’t want to believe so they can have the reality they want. 

From my perspective, the asylum just got... bigger.
I used to try and talk to them, but they didn't logic themselves into their mindset and I can't logic them out of it, so whatever. These days, I just ignore them as much as possible, and when I can't, when it's actual family or friends, I say, Look, I'm immuno-compromised, my father's in his 70s, both my sisters have lung issues. This thing gets to us and our whole family is going down. Sure, there's a 99% survivability rate, but 1% starts looking like a big fucking number when that shit hits your family fan. Does the mask work? I'm not going to argue with you. If there's even a chance I could save a life by wearing the mask and the only thing I risk is looking like a fool, I'll wear the fucking mask. I'll wear a rainbow clown afro and a honking nose on each nipple if that helps. I'll survive looking like a fool; people are dying from Covid. Oh, I'm living in fear? I wear oven mitts when I bake, I don't fear the fucking oven. I'm taking a reasonable precaution against foreseeable harm.   


If they're still in it with me after that, it's usually because blah blah blah God's will, and there's nothing I can do about that except say they're free to put their faith in prayer and I'm free to put mine in a mask. I get the "You're a sheep," counter-argument a lot. My go-to is "You're an ostrich," but I'm told "You're a cunt," shuts them down just as well if not better.
I’m feeling some sort of mix of “everyone around me is stupid”, “I wish I could do fun family things like everyone else is”, and “I must be losing my god damn mind”. Literally everyone else in my life is playing fast and loose with the safety guidelines except my grandparents, because one of them is a retired respiratory therapist. 

Friends and family I previously thought of as smart, caring individuals are going on vacations, dates, or whining about mask policies. Meanwhile looking down on me because I’ve found a way to not return to my shitty tourism job and still pay my bills. My kids pediatrician encouraged getting their hair cut at a salon & taking pictures with Santa this year. I’m about to spend $40 to drive through a park with Christmas lights in an attempt to give my toddler some sense of a normal holiday after feeling like I robbed him of a summer of fun — which I did. Because every time I even took him to the grocery store, strangers tried to touch him. 

After sticking to strict isolation, mask wearing & cleaning habits since March, I’m simultaneously worn out and reinvigorated. I honestly don’t think I’m superior in any way to the people around me, but this shit is starting to feel like some basic Darwinism.
I'm a middle school teacher. So far at least half the staff have contracted the virus at some point this year. Every week another child has to quarantine or tests positive. I had to call my grandmother, who is in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's, and explain that I've not felt well and have been exposed multiple times at work. All she wanted was for me to bring my puppy with me to dinner for Thanksgiving. Turns out I'm the only family member not going. And I'm the family scapegoat, so I'm sure tomorrow I'll have to deal with the phone calls and texts of how it's not a big deal and why wouldn't I just come and reminders that I missed Easter too.

And I'm out of antidepressants.
I’m in a weird position. I have to speak with people daily from NY and NJ for work but in live in the south. Since March, the people I speak with for work are far more cautious/nervous about this than the people I know and they always bring it up. I talk more freely about my concerns with work people because they seem to also be concerned. I’ve never been that personal in a work setting but it at least allows some catharsis.
I work in hospice, so I tell them to keep it up, because I'm the one that pulls the plug. Reactions are awkward 100% of the time.
I actually almost feel justified. My husband's family all caught covid because they were at a party together and here we are with no covid because neither of us are about that life right now (we are hoping everyone recovers fine, but idk if that is gonna happen. His parents are both high risk). We miss our family, but safety first.
I was in Wyoming recently (necessary travel) and was the only one wearing a mask inside. While in line someone asked “what are ya scared or something”, so I pulled down my mask a tiny bit and said “no, I have covid,” dude had an ‘oh shit face’ for sure.
It’s harder when it’s people I love who are not being careful, such as still hosting holiday gatherings, seeing each other indoors without masks, etc. And then writing me off as the shrill one when I bring any of it up. 😕
I don’t know.  It’s hard.  I feel helpless a lot.  Feeling so isolated is getting to me and I honestly can’t remember the last time I’ve dealt with so much suicidal ideation but then I think about how I would feel if I chose to shirk my responsibility to the community and my choice created an unnecessary risk for others and I know that the shame, guilt and isolation from that would be significantly worse so I keep pushing on, venting to my loved ones and trying to also support them. 

I am also in the really cool position of being able to watch my children absorb and adjust so flawlessly and so selflessly to this current state of the world.  We don’t give these kids enough credit, we really don’t.  They are carrying this society right now and just displaying such an incredible level of grace and flexibility; not just mine but most children.  They are struggling, too but just in a way that is so innocent, so devoid of politics or bias compared to the adults and they are discovering strengths and abilities within themselves that I think most adults should really admire.  I’m proud of these damn kids and they keep me going.

I wanted to edit to add: I appreciate people’s concern and care for me so much.  I am so lucky to have a good support system and I am okay.  I am safe.  I have thoughts but never plans because I do absolutely know my value.  I just wish people gave more credit to the mental health side of this experience; I value so greatly our responsibility to stop the spread, to stay home, to mask but I also want people to know it’s okay to struggle through it, we aren’t alone in it even when it feels lonely.
My wife's a nurse. And she's working more now than ever because.....what a fucking shock! There's a shortage of nurses because they keep getting sick from asswipes like this. And I have no fucking problem telling them this. If you don't practice social distancing or wear a mask and you get sick I think you should be banned from going to a hospital. Because your fucking stupidity, arrogance and overall selfishness is literally putting the only people who can do anything about this fucking bullshit at risk. Die in your fucking house alone asshole. Keep my wife out of your crap. 

And the irony? If my wife read this she would be super pissed at me. Because unlike all of you assholes who refuse to wear a mask and practice social distancing she's a good person who has, and will continue, to put herself at risk to help people.
After having too many customers not take the mask rules seriously, we hired a bouncer.

I work in a bookstore.
Not well. Not well at all to be honest. My daughter has a congenital heart defect so I'm in a position where my wife and I are forced to take it seriously, more so than others. Murderous rage is all I feel all fucking day. My urge to rip people's heads off with my barehands and knowing I'm actually quite capable of doing so and restraining myself is a level of self control I'm achieving only through anxiety medications and limiting my time among other people. I've altogether stopped going on social media except here where it's completely curated. I no longer talk to a lot of people. At work I don't interact with coworkers. This shit has ruined my fucking life. I can't wait for a vaccine and to just get on with life.
A healthy dose of depression
I tune out Anyone making fun of me for trying to be safe. I’m immunocompromised and have been a hermit since March, literally never leaving my house. I took two trips to Walmart and got covid. That was a month ago and I’m on 7 medications, in haler, nebulizer, I live on the 2nd floor and can’t even make it down the stairs. Call me paranoid but the safest place is not around other people who do not care about you. If these people don’t care about their own loved ones possibly getting infected from them they’re not going to care about you. Protect yourself.
Where I'm at it is acceptable to follow the guidelines and it is encourage.
I tend not to go out at all,  and I have enough people around me who I care about who follow the rules too. "Those who mind don't matter, those who matter don't mind."
I kept doing my thing, and insisting on social distancing and masks if they wanted to be around me, until I could stop going in to the office. 

Now I refuse to go in, and work from home 100% until this wave is under control. 

I *might* go in to do some on-site only work, IF it can be guaranteed that I can work in the area ALONE, or that anyone coming in wears a mask *fucking properly* and *keeps their goddamn distance.* 

I am done fucking around with this shit. Dick nosers and chin diapers and people walking right up to breathe in your fucking face, big ass training classes with people from all over being held in the conference rooms, people coming in for meetings and hanging out, just as though a *quarter of a million people* aren't fucking DEAD. 

Gone.

Families shattered, lives of their loved ones in shambles, DEAD. 

I can't fathom how people don't get that and I'm done being polite, I'm over being rhetorical. 

Wear your fucking mask, wash your goddamn hands, stay the fuck back, from me, from everyone, as much as possible, and stay the fuck home as much as you can. 

The absolute worst part of all this is we're at the beginning of this wave. Quarter of a million of us are already dead. Almost 13 MILLION are infected, that we know about, and it's climbing at an alarming rate. 43% over yesterday, in fact. 

But by all means, go crowd around a table and eat with family and friends. Then go wear a mask on your chin while you cram into big box stores to buy shit you don't fucking need. Get infected. Then go infect people where you work on Monday. So they can infect people where they socialize. Who can infect people where they work. 

God, we're fucking idiots. I wonder if we even deserve to survive this thing.
I don't know about other people, but I just get extremely stressed out and stops going outside, and manifest many signs of mental health issues.

In short, "I don't". :(
Other people at work seem to make fun of me and make a big gesture about putting their mask on correctly when I come around. This is because I was a squeaky wheel to their boss about them wearing them incorrectly before. Now when they act like that around me I just don’t react because obviously I got what I wanted.
I’m a COVID nurse. It infuriates me. Words can’t describe how fucking angry I am.
Teenage me thought everyone around me were idiots.  
Later, I realized I was just being an edgy depressed teenager.  
  
Turns out teenage me was right.
By reminding myself that my actions are keeping others safe, and those who choose to go about life just as before are simply selfish and self centered. My circle of friends has shrunk by quite a bit over the last few months. How you choose to act during the pandemic speaks volumes about your character, or lack thereof.
I find comfort in knowing I’m not a narcissistic dick face.
Xanax.
man, i had to tell my mom i couldn't come to see her tomorrow because someone got covid at work. She's almsot 70, i'm not going to get her sick. 

I haven't seen her since jan and she cries everytime we talk on the phone. it's fucking heartbreaking, but i'm not going to kill my mother. That'd be it for me. 

I smoked a bowl and played magic online with friends. Shit sucks, but she'll eventually understand, maybe; who knows.
I cope by prioritizing myself for once in my GD life. Before this pandemic I was always being everywhere for everyone else and sacrificing me time or just alone time with the husband because we always had somewhere to be and I hated it, constantly visiting with friends or family was beginning to feel like a chore. Now I have a valid reason to say no to anyone else and put myself and my principles first and if they don't like it, fuck it, I have absolutely no cares whatsoever. Don't wanna stay friends with me, wanna think I'm crazy? That's okay, I didn't need you then, I don't now.
To be honest, I'm finding it really difficult. 

My girlfriend's mum has had cancer for the last year and was not looking good towards the start of the second lockdown in the UK. I persuaded her to move back in with her family just in case things went south. Since we also work together, I decided to stay at home and manage things here, including both of our workloads. Things did go south, and gf's mum was moved back home so that everyone could be there for her. I took a few days off work as I thought it was essential, and was there when she passed on a Saturday morning. 

That was an exceptional circumstance. After what happened I returned home and am continuing to manage our work while the family grieves. This Sunday it's my 30th birthday. I'll unfortunately be spending it alone, because it's not an exceptional circumstance. My girlfriend cannot come back home because it's not an exceptional circumstance. 

Sorry about brain dump. It is really tough.
It's hard. There are days where you sit and curse the world because you see people living "normal" lives, and you can't. You wish people took it seriously because you hate hearing how people you know and love and respect are getting it. You lose sleep over wondering if fitting in would be worth a possible exposure. You make hard decisions where there is no right answer, and you're doing the best you can. You might lose friends, and you mourn those relationships lost as much as you mourn not getting hugs when you see people, or going to social events. But you wake up every day knowing you're keeping the ones closest to you safe. You see the people in your bubble, be it family or friends and think that you're the luckiest person in the world to be stuck with these people. You celebrate the small things, and laugh as much as you can. You do the best you can with each new day, knowing you're doing what you know is right.
So much peer pressure, makes me just avoid talking to people all together. 

I work at a large science lab and I was blown away when I found out 75% of my team were going to thanksgiving events with their families. Everyone has this won’t happen to me mentality.
Indifference to people's opinions. 


If me wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer bothers someone that much they need to rethink their priorities and ill mention it to them.
My sister was diagnosed with cancer at the beginning of this year right before covid, it's interesting that most people will argue with me about masks until I point out my sister is going through chemo right now, then they're like "Well that makes sense for you to wear a mask"... they're so close to getting it sometimes, but just miss the point.

I'm not a unique case, most people know someone who's health is compromised, that's why everyone should wear masks. It's just so simple.
Being a brown person in Southern Utah, where it’s super mormon is not ideal. I already get some weird looks for my skin color and adding a mask on top of that seems to make people more suspicious of me. I think masks are mandated in the entire state due to the overflow in hospitals but you’ll still see people in coffee shops ordering drinks without a mask on.
So far, by nearly losing my business, hating most people I know and feeling about as helpless as possible. I'm a tattoo artist. By trade I can't not sit in strangers bubbles. I now work a remote cs job 40 hours a week and tattoo just enough to cover my booth rent. I still feel unsafe. The bar next door has their porch enclosed with winter plastic and has a full band playing live most weekends.

It's really fucking hard not to give up. I'm so disappointed in most people I know. With the absolute lack of funding, it's hard find any hope. If nothing happens until Biden takes over, that means financial aide won't be distributed before March at the earliest, and I will lose my business or get sick by then.  two counties around Raleigh are in exponential growth rn.
Don't give a fuck about them
Before I got laid off, I developed a reputation at my job for being ready to dump ALL THE INFORMATION on people who argued unnecessarily with me. My Trump-loving coworkers quickly figured out that if they didn't want to be forcibly educated in basic microbiology and epidemiology they needed to mask up and shut up around me.
I have an “eyes on your own plate” approach. Since I don’t leave the house, I don’t see how crowded the restaurants are or how pact the stores are. I block/unfollow/unfriend anyone on my social medias who post about going out so I dont have to see it. I know I’m not crazy for acting like this, so I don’t allow anyone who’s not taking this seriously to even show up on my radar.
I have around 5 friends or mostly people I know that were denying the virus even existed and had to be hospitalised. They are now following every guidance. Fuck those people. My respect has been lost for them forever.
I catch myself making excuses like "I've got a heart condition" which is true, but I'd be taking the same precautions regardless. 

And the most rediculous thing is that the people I am saying this to most often are medical professionals!  Why are the nurses at the rheumatology clinic and even my sleep doctor acting surprised that I do not wanting to come into the office just to renew a prescription!
Try this on for size. My company is forcing me to be client facing. I can't say more but the way I'm being treated because I don't want to makes me feel super guilty and that's wrong. But you know, do it or fuck off.

This pandemic has shown what fickle, lack of backbone managers I currently have. All hiding at home like a bunch of pussies.
This scenario legitimately just happened. I popped by my dads for a pre thanksgiving get together. Unbeknownst to me, he invited 3 of my cousins and randomly told an anecdote about how his boss got covid and he found out to day “haha” what a laugh! My cousins and i were pissed and I left last to explain to my dad why and he basically just bashed liberals.... so how did I cope? There was no need because I know me and my cousins were in the right and my dad just felt foolish for letting that VERY IMPORTANT information slip. 
Im still mad
Look at them like they’re stupid, and laugh as I walk away. That or just annoyingly glare at them until they get uncomfortable and leave
One advantage of getting older is that everyone assumes I know what I am doing.  No one questions me about anything.
I am in this boat too. Everyone in the town I’m in thinks it’s some weird hoax & the cases and deaths aren’t a big deal apparently. And IM FREAKED OUT BY COVID. I don’t want to die, or accidentally spread it to someone who spreads it to other people. Like, why can’t we all just be cautious and safe. If I’m wrong, I stayed locked up in my house for some months (&I truly absolutely don’t mind. I enjoy it honestly) but if you’re all wrong you could potentially kill people. People you love. Or die yourself. That’s so fucked up. Don’t take the risk
It's mostly the "sheep" comments that infuriate me to no end but I find it hard to intelligently counter that point. It's just so non-sensical that I struggle to find a good rebuttal and just get frustrated.
I teach.

Today I am at home. I've got a cold but I woke up today and my sinuses are blocked. I cant smell shit.
 
My temperature is a bit high. I have a cold. That's what happens. 

I am not going to work. I am arranging a test. I do this because I am in daily and weekly contact with hundreds of pupils aged 11-18. 

I was also off for two weeks because a student I work closely with had it. I've only just got back of course.

Work is shitty with me about it. They're frustrated I am following procedures. They have sent out a circular email stating, "please ensure that absense due to Covid symptoms are due to accurate identification of Covid related symptoms".

Some staff are literally gloating about how they came in with X and Y symptom because they knew they didn't have it. It was just a cold, or a bug.

I know I have a cold. I am also not arrogant or stupid enough to believe I could tell if I had covid too. So today, I cant smell shit. So I'll go get a test. 

Because that's the responsible thing to do. I feel bad about my pupils and I am so sad about the impact this is having on their education. But as long as they keep the schools open, I will follow government procedures to the letter. It's the only ethical thing to do to protect others.

It continues to amaze me how apathetic some other teachers and senior staff are about being off because of it.
Idk, everyone around me is pretty much following the rules (Bay Area)
So I can move freely when time is frozen? Or am I stuck there reading? Cuz if it's the former what's the problem? If the latter I can learn a lot of skills easily. Or freeze time by touching clifford and having a nap

I cant see a down side either way
"hey could you hold these textbooks for me?"
If you're a very slow learner and a reader, and of you touched a book in some other language, would you get old till you are done deciphering and reading it?
Will you go from 10years to 90years in just the flash of normal time???
Hell yeah! I get to take my time reading, absorb all the info, and I get enough time to actually read books instead of just skimming! Sign me up!
So you are telling me that I can freeze time whenever I wish for however long and when I resume time I learn all the knowledge from a book of my choice? Hell yes sign me the fuck up.
100% would accept. It gives me so many opportunities to be by myself. I like reading so if I really had to read something even if I accidentally touched it and hated it I would. I get to spend hours upon hours by myself and it’s a pretty good way to cheat on tests or steal money or whatever
So if you accidentally touched a bible for example, you'd be stuck frozen in time for like fifty hours? I'm a bit confused about the monkey's paw fine print of this deal, but it doesn't sound that catastrophic.

Edit: yeah, you guys are right - fifty hours is a massive underestimation. That would cover the bulk of the old testament, but the whole thing is probably closer to eighty hours. But hey, supernatural speed reading...  :P
1. I can effectively teleport by reading a book.
2. I am technically immortal as long as I read.
3. There's all the time I ever wanted.
So you're saying I instantly deeply and intuitively understand the information contained in the book, but as a penalty I then have to actually read the content, in the sense of passing my eyes over the actual characters on the page at a normal reading pace, even though I already understand it all? **Sign me the fuck up.** I would murder so many advanced physics and math books, it wouldn't even be funny.  The actual reading part is like the least hard part of understanding most of that stuff. Or hell, advanced statistics and machine learning.
What happens if you touch an eReader/Kindle?
There is like literally no downside. Your downside is just the bonus ability to freeze time by touching books
Sounds like nothing but positives to me. Sure I'd accept it.
Do my bodily functions still work? *how* frozen is time? Can I drink a beer while I read the book? How far from the book can I walk to read the book until time unfreezes? Can I freeze time by touching a book, walk to another state, read it, and have traveled to that state for free and instantly? How much can I interact with the frozen world? Do I still have to pee/eat/poo while time is frozen? Can I sleep or take naps if its a huge book? Does it matter if the content is the same/similar but its a different author? Like would two copies of the same book require me to read both cover-to-cover even if the only difference is that one of them has a different blurb, praise page, and a forward? What about books I can't read because they're in a different language? Is this voluntary, or could someone potentially drive me insane by tossing a wheelbarrow of Dictionaries at me printed by several different companies in different languages?

Too many variables, I'll pass.
Do I absorb it as I read it or as I touch it? Because your question kind of contradicts itself.
Reddit, would you eat a banana for $1,000,000,000 with the drawback being that you know not everyone loves bananas?
OP asks a question and then argues all the answers.
I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding, but why would I have to read the book if I've already absorbed the knowledge instantly from touching it?
Well that’s not really instantly absorbing it then it’s just reading the book just time is freezes while you are
Um yeah, no negative to this at all. Time control and infinite knowledge...
I'm guessing part of the curse is that if you're just moving books around or if you accidentally touch the wrong book getting the right book out of the bookshelf that you have to read both. It's a bit dicey, but also having control over time would be pretty sweet. Do you age while time is stopped? Do you need food and drink and poo breaks like normal? If I read a book, finish it, time starts up, I set it down for a moment to flush my full toilet, and come back to put the book away does time stop and I have to start all over again?
Wait.

I gain knowledge.

***AMD***

I have time to read all the books I want?

Where's the tradeoff?
No one is asking the real questions. If I decide to read a novel while frozen in time, and I skip a line by accident, do I have to play Waldo to find it again because theoretically I wouldn’t have read the entire book cover to cover?
can I put the book down and do other things while time is frozen?

because I would do a lot with that
Sure, as long as I actually integrate and understand the book

I’ll just listen to fiction on audio books.
Not a curse but a blessing so yes.
Hell yeah! That would be amazing. 

Edit: is there any upper limit on the 'amount' on knowledge I could gain through this power? If not then that just makes it better
My friends would think I was irrationally afraid of books. Hanging out having a good time, perhaps drunk. 

“Hey check out this book.” Hands book

Stuck for the next 20 hours reading a damn book when I just wanted some chicken wings.
This is another example of the type of question I’d like to ban from AskReddit
it would totally ruin browsing at the book store.

would also be very nervous walking near unstable book shelves and/or libraries.
So if you are forced/ required to read the book cover to cover before the world starts turning again anyways, what the fuck is the point of instantly learning about the book? Now you're just forced to read a book but the whole story has already been spoiled for you. This sounds very dumb.
So basically I get more time to read, retain more information from each book, and can control time. This would be awesome! I’d be able to just keep a book in my pocket that’s short and each time I want to pause time I can just touch the book.
What if you fall down an open manhole or have a heart attack and die while time is frozen, thus leaving the book in a state of being perpetually unread?
Am I allowed to answer if I'm a guy?

Because I ended up becoming "the Excel guy" in my office. All of my spreadsheets are exquisitely color-coded.
My grade 9 science teacher forced us all to do it. He said that by colour coding everything you understood the material better because you had to think about it longer to colour code it and understand what other things it was associated with. Not just zone out and go into transcribing mode. He also made us do end of unit study guides. They had to be colour coded,  a set amount of drawings, and unit words and definitions. The drawings were doodles based on things in the unit. He would mark them and hand them back before the test which was great because he knew if he needed to help us with something before we bombed the test. He was also a mma fighter with cauliflower ears and not the type of guy you would expect to demand rainbow coloured notes.

Edit: There's a lot of people asking for examples so I'll make one up this afternoon.
There's a PM at my company that does this. No idea how the hell she has the focus and time to take such detailed technicolor dream-notes during meetings but I've never had a problem with getting any relevant info from her so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Gotta respect note taking game like that.
We all became bullet journalists
Certain law school prep guides teach you to take notes on court opinions using different colors.  90% of first year law students show up with 4 different color highlighters.  By the end of the last year, few still use them. 

In legal practice I have developed color coding for notes of the cases I'm working on.  I have not yet found a way to put a heart over the "i" in my filings.
I used different ink and highlighter colors to compensate for terrible ADD. I work in a chemistry lab now. Sometimes I’ll still use brightly colored pens to record my results for fun, but I don’t ever switch between colors/color code anything anymore. All the different colored ink/highlighting helped me remember my notes come exam time, so now that I’m out of college, I don’t need to switch between colors. I Lowkey miss color coding and taking notes sometimes, though.
I will never forget sitting in class and asking the girl sitting next to me for a pen, and she turns back to me with a straight face and says to me "what color?"
 
Edit: This... blew up. Thank you for the award, that marks my first (but hopefully not the last)!
I still color code based on class. Each class has a color. This color includes the folder color, the pen color, the sticky note color that the assignments are written on and placed in my planner on the date they are due.

I also teach intro statistics to undergraduates.. Where I also color-code parts of the equations and the values that get inserted to the equation, so the students can see where the numbers come from more easily.

*edited to change kids to students. That was a poor word choice on my part.  Apologies.
I work in IT, and yes. I still have all those colors and still use them all in my day planner.
I'm a medical lab technician.

I took notes with a million different coloured pens in college, up until two years ago. I graduated at age 41. 

Just bought myself a nice new set of gel pens. 

Real talk: multiple colours really helped me categorize and compress complex ideas into things I could remember. It helped a lot in understanding the material and studying for tests.
I think they're teachers now, and yes, they still use all those colors.
I work in an office setting now and do still like to use different colored pens for things, if the situation allows it. 

I don’t know if this will make sense to anyone else, but I love colors. I especially like the idea of colors being associated with ideas, personalities, names or themes. “Oh, today is Monday. I think orange is a good Monday color. Pink is Friday. Green is Wednesday.” I love how Windows 10 allows me to change the colors of tiles so that my computer seems more like “me.” I am constantly changing the colors of my Apple watch face. 

I dunno. I think I have a problem!

ETA: The thoughts and discussions being shared here have been very interesting and eye-opening! Thanks for the silver as well. :) I do just want to add that I am fairly certain I do not have synesthesia. I know someone that does and from my very limited knowledge of it, it isn’t a voluntary association of colors like mine probably would be. I always automatically like to associate stuff with color or mood, but I don’t know that it happens involuntarily. Think of what I do as more of what happens in the video game Persona 5, where each character has a color associated with them intentionally. I love that kind of stuff!
My wife did this when we were in school and she still loves using multicolored pens for everything she can. She even uses her own pretty colors for writing in the labels for things at work. You can always tell work that was done by her from everyone else's. A true ray of sunshine.

Edit: I told my wife about all the upvotes on this comment and she is thrilled about all the attention :)

Edit 2: (1/27 7pm) thank you so much to both of the kind strangers who awarded this comment! Never thought it would blow up so much! The wife is happy :)
I actually do!  I'm now a professional scientist and it makes my lab notebook pretty, plus frankly often it's really helpful to have multiple colors.  I also like having a bunch of colors for seminar speakers because it somehow keeps me more interested to choose a different color for a different speaker.

Honestly though, the core reason is the main reason I enjoy multiple colors is because I often feel the secret to success against procrastination is negotiating with your inner five year old.  "Ok, you need to write these notes, but if you *do* you can choose what color to write them in!"  You might as well find a little happiness in the world where you can. :)
Unfortunately not allowed in the line of work i chose.

So now i use 50 different colored Post-It notes.

Improvise, adapt and overcome.
I am a med student now. Also I am failing because I no longer have time to use fancy pens and prepare colorful notes for all my classes.
I’m one of those girls currently in college. I don’t do it because I’m organized or anything, I just fucking love buying pens/markers and otherwise I can’t pay attention to my notes. It’s aesthetically appealing to me, which immensely helps encourage me to actually take notes.
I have a few friends that do that, one of them is studying to be a doctor, moved the colored pens to a tablet to easily switch colors. Another wants to become a Sign Language Translator(keep forgetting the actual term)
A guy classmate of mine did this. One of the smartest in the class. His notes were fantastic. He's an engineer now and has a great family life from what I see on his FB. Cool guy! Jason if you're reading this you rock my dude!
they migrated to /r/fountainpens and use 50 different inks with 100 different pens now.
I'm a high school English teacher and there's a big correlation between note taking skills and success in my classes. Color coding notes definitely helps.
I mostly write everything in purple now, but sometimes I use other colors and I like colorful post it notes. I am working towards being a Kindergarten teacher.
Sure do. I’m almost 35, in college, and still using multi colored pens
EDIT: Slow down, if you want a copy, message me.

EDIT 2: I'm sorry if I don't get to everyone, there's a lot you guys asking. Hope you understand! Have a nice day :)

I color-coded my notes. I have OCD and it makes everything feel neater and easier to flick through. If you want, I'll give my system as I found it to be very useful, maybe you will too. Oh, and I am currently unemployed but due to the recent birth of my son, James, I've been looking into jobs :)

Or, an alternative way. I use black for titles and subtitles, as, for me, the title isn't that important. The dates are written in a subtle color, because the focus should be on the stuff below. I'm not focusing on the title, more on the definitions, key words, diagrams, instructions etc. Blue is the most used, as that's usually what I use for simple stuff. Red is used for diagrams, definitions and instructions and research shows that red helps with more detailed information than blue. Also, red is cool. I highlight key words in pastel pink because it looks pretty with blue and highlight in pastel orange because fire and shit. As for the summary, I write it in grey with a black border. It's a lot but I mainly just focus on aesthetic more than anything.
I paint for a living, so I switched from pens to paint. The gel pens were fun but impractical. I stick to basic ink colors because it's easier to read things with a strong constrast. But I have sharpies in every color because doodling is fun.
I'm an engineer with dyslexia and ADHD...i took notes with tons of colors and still do now. The colors help me stay organized, keep track of numbers and not mix up information. I keep "like with like" categorically and have a whole notation system. A friend recommended I try it in college and it helped me go from C's to B+ and A's. I'm good at "picturing" notes and the colors helped to guide my brain to the relevant information in my memory picture, if that makes sense? In all one color it just looked like a jumbled mess....Either way, yes I still use colored pens as a 30 year old adult engineer 🤷‍♀️
My cousin did this in HS, she is now a very organized and successful nurse.
I went from being in school to be a grade school art teacher to stay at home/homeschooling mom to now finishing up a graduate degree in Computer Science and have job lined up as a software developer. And yes, I still use all those colors (and elflord in VIM because COLORS! And it’s the easiest for me to read).
This reminds me of a girl in one of my college classes.  It would be inaccurate to say she took notes.  She took **transcripts**.  She would write down everything in class.  Everything the teacher said, every quote from the book that we read.  Even every rabbit trail the class went down, she'd be taking meticulous notes, including asking students for their first and last name so she could attribute the quotes properly.

Our mid-term "exam" was a 10-page paper.  She spent 30 hours on hers and got a 97%.  I spent 2 hours on mine and got a 93%.

I was much happier trading that 4% of my grade for 28 hours of my life.
I had a friend who used to do that. 

One of the smartest people I knew. 

She is married now and has a kid and is a stay-at-home mom.
I knew a guy who would take color coded notes in class. THEN immediately after class go through them and then do even more advanced color-coding with added references and stuff. 

He was probably the hardest working and smartest guy I've ever known. AND he grew up in a small village in Venezuela and now is a US citizen and officer in the Navy. Made me embarrassed that he is a better speaker in two languages than I am in one.
It's my time to shine!

I really sucked at taking notes. I failed out of 7th grade. I scraped by in high school. I got into the lowest tier university in the state only because they automatically accepted anyone with an ACT score over 21. Then I flunked out. 

Twice. 

I eventually did graduate with a degree (that I never used), but it was with a 2.7 GPA. This is just to demonstrate how awful I was at note-taking, studying, anything involving recording and retaining information of the academic persuasion. 

Then I decided I was really tired of living below the line of poverty and got a master's in science. This required being at the very least passable at recording and retaining academic information. 

This is where the copious color-coded pens came in. And the color-coded highlighters. And the color-coded sticky notes. And the color-coded accordion folders. 

I was finally able to properly record information in a way I could retain, which led to my appointment as research assistant, then contributions to multiple academic publications, and ultimately a dream job at the R&D division of a certain computer company. Colored pens got me out of poverty  and gave me the ability to help provide for my family. 

TL;DR I now work as a researcher at a computer company. I am now paid to study. I still have all my pens.
Bold of you to assume that's a girl only thing.
I don't write much anymore but I still use coloured pens for my personal notes. The colour depends on my mood.

When I used to keep a meticulous fitness agenda, everything was colour coded.
[removed]
I have a bag of scented markers and a bag of rainbow pens I keep in my office for when I attend work meetings.

Also not a teacher but I am a director of a facility that serves kids.
They now work for the fbi as it analysts.
They are all called Penelope Garcia.
Ended up in med school so not doing bad I guess?

I do still continue color coding everything in college as I did in high school and before. 

My case of Synesthesia lets me "see" words, letters and certain concepts in different colors. By using the same colors to actually write the words or underline them I solidify the memory links in my brain and it helps me remember things. 

I also take graphic notes with arrows & double lines or write in groups of small areas, etc so that I can clearly categorize things I need to remember. If you're a visual lerner this helps a lot!
Nurse here. 4 colored pens are an absolute must for my job to keep organized. On my assignment sheet anything ordinary in black, code status in red, things I need to do in blue, lab results in green. Then I'm at peace.
I'm a dramatic artist and I used all the pens just for that.  My teachers hated me for giving them rainbows of notes and work but I always wrote them a little key on the back of the paper so they grudgingly accepted it. Except one math teacher who liked and looked forward to my stuff. 
I'm now a dog boarder and my schedules are so colorful only I can decipher them. 
I still art but not as much unfortunately :(
We all have bulletjournals now
Wife did this as a kid, through high school and became amped in college. But now she's a teacher and writes in different colors for a living.

We're currently moving out of the country and she can't part with pens she doesn't even use. She managed to smuggle them into her carry on bag. 

Send help....
As a guy who has been doing this for almost 7 years of uni now, I can say that its absolutely worth it. Pleasant looking and well organized notes go a long way to make reviewing material 100 times more enjoyable
I am still in school, I used to get straight A’s, but now im not even straight.

Edit: I spend to much to asking girls to borrow their pens.
Im (m22) in university and this year im trying to really improve my studying and note taking outside of lectures. So, i decided to do 3 coloured notes with red blue and black pens because all i the girls I know take notes like that and they all have much better GPAs than I do
Leslie Knope from Parks and Rec was definitely one of those girls, only she replaced the pens with [binders](https://i.imgur.com/rLHUIK4.gifv)
I graduated with my PhD. I still have a love of extremely neat notes with color coding and fonts and neatly drawn graphs. My licensing exam study binder was a thing of beauty and I actually wound up making a power point presentation for last years residents on the exam and study tips, complete with several personalized memes. This shit brings me so much joy :) 

I still have about 8 different colors of pens in my office, although now all my reports are typed and have to conform to a particular aesthetic so I'm stuck. I do, however, now have a handmade stone pen courtesy of my father in law and a very cool fountain pen made from trimmed branches of a 100 year old olive tree that my husband gifted me. So no more neat colors but my love of excellent writing materials lives on.
I was exactly this girl, I had about 50 glittery coloured gel pens, and for each school assignment I would choose 5 random different ones to write and decorate my notebooks with.

20 years later, I'm a graphic designer and illustrator! I still love making things nice and colourful with cool typography. I basically did not change at all, I just have slightly better taste now.
Not a girl but in my business law class during undergrad we were allowed to use our notes for the tests. It was much easier to color code everything so I could find it quickly if I needed to reference it (different colors for terms, cases, outcomes, etc)

I’ve been unemployed for about 6 months
Yup. Homeschooling SAHM here. I use one set of colors for my personal planner (each person has their own color, bills have one, holidays and birthdays share one, family and community events have their own, and finally the animals have a color.)  School planning has another set for each subject

"Our discovery confirms that adaptation to an anaerobic environment is not unique to single-celled eukaryotes, but has also evolved in a multicellular, parasitic animal. Hence, H. salminicola provides an opportunity for understanding the evolutionary transition from an aerobic to an exclusive anaerobic metabolism."
Egypt and Ethiopia are close to going to war due to Ethiopia building a dam on the Nile River. Ethiopia is diverting some water and limiting water flow to Egypt.

They're trying to get this railroaded through quickly before anyone has a chance to notice, and we can't roll it back. 

The main issue with this proposed bill, is that it actually does nothing whatsoever to protect or prevent child exploitation on the Internet, and dismantling encryption across a broad range of products, while threatening companies with significant fees and fines for non-compliance, is fear-mongering.

Astronomer here!  We might have a bright naked eye comet next month in the northern hemisphere- our first since 1997! [ Comet C/2019 Atlas Y4 is brightening really quickly](https://astronomy.com/news/observing/2020/03/comet-atlas-may-soon-be-visible-to-the-naked-eye), and by May might be one of the brightest things in the night sky!

I mean, comets are notoriously tricky to predict in brightness, as it might just break apart as it gets closer to the sun.  But it's really exciting to think about, albeit no one has heard about it because of the pandemic (though granted, doesn't a pandemic need a bright comet?).

Edit: you might be able to get it in binoculars right now, or at least have fun trying!  [Here](https://heavens-above.com/comet.aspx?cid=C%2F2019%20Y4&lat=50&lng=15&loc=%C4%8CR&alt=270&tz=CET) is a star chart for it.

And yes, the last bright northern hemisphere "Great Comet" was Hale-Bopp, which was up for about a year to the naked eye.  If you were a southern hemisphere resident in 2006, however, you probably remember Comet McNaught.

Edit 2: because many are asking, that bright “star” in the evening sky is actually Venus! It’s around its peak brightness and height *right now* and you should go take a look if your social distancing allows it! Might as well take a break from Netflix and look at a whole ‘nother planet. :)

Edit 3: no there is no chance of the comet hitting us or affecting life on Earth beyond potentially getting bright.
I would hope the locusts plaguing East Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. It’s describing some swarms as being the size of New York, and they are eating their harvest, threatening widespread famine. I think without Coronavirus we would mobilize to try to control this population the way we did for Zika carrying mosquitos in the America’s.

Edit: [this NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/21/807483297/why-are-swarms-of-locusts-wreaking-havoc-in-east-africa) describes how in 2018 an unfortunate series of cyclones from the Indian Ocean hit an extremely remote area of the Arabian Peninsula known as the "Empty Quarter." This produced extraordinary rain and gave them what they needed to breed. Because a second cyclone hit occurred during their breeding cycle, instead of drying out and having most of their population die out in the desert, the population exploded. In favorable conditions they can multiply by 400X their population every 6 months. Then they mass migrated. 

Also for clarity, a swarm was identified as 3 times the size of NYC.

There's a video of a squad of our SAS confronting a man in a field. He is compliant and unarmed. The SAS guy asks 'want me to drop this cunt' a couple of times and is told to radio the superior. He does, but you can't hear the response. He then shoots the man.

There have been stories breaking in the past of other very questionable or fucked up activity by the SAS in Afghanistan, but (as far as I know) that never had video accompanying it.  The video of this encounter confirms there *wasn't* some misunderstanding or panic...just a cold blooded killing.

If I may wear my tin foil hat for a moment, it's *terribly* convenient for the government and armed forces that this news broke in the middle of this crisis. A lot of people I know either didn't see this break or only read the headline and assumed it was some kind of misunderstanding.

The second person in history has been cured of HIV. Not treated, *cured*, as in they no longer have it. This is a huge step in making HIV/AIDS a curable disease. It was a death sentence. If you had it, you could only count your days. After Keith Haring, a very successful artist that died from AIDS, donated a large portion of his net worth to HIV/AIDS research and started the Keith Haring Foundation that focuses on AIDS research and education, it became something people could live with, and was no longer an inevitable death. Now, two people have had their HIV cured. This is the start of something big. If HIV/AIDS can soon be cured as easy as other STIs, then Keith Haring, Freddie Mercury, and everyone else that have died from AIDS complications will be able to rest easy.

https://haveibeenpwned.com/ is a website that checks through a database of breaches to see if any account associated with your email has been compromised.

Edit: being pwned is pretty common, especially if you use the same email for many websites. There is no need to be concerned if you have been pwned multiple times; almost all will be from mass data breaches and it is unlikely you will ever be targeted specifically. However, *it is a good idea to close accounts you no longer use and to change the passwords on accounts you use regularly*.

Radio stations from around the globe. Just spin it a bit and click where you want to get a list of radio stations from that country. Great for people who like foreign music, language learners, or people looking to reconnect with something "back home".

Sorry for the long post, but here it goes:

(Corrected spelling and added some new links and name for latest Tracktion version)

[vstplanet.com](https://vstplanet.com) and [vst4free.com](https://vst4free.com) if you want to get loads of awesome Virtual Studio Technology instruments and effects. Also has lots of other downloads for freeware Digital Audio Workstations, Trackers, Editors, and other tools.

To make some great drum sounds, there is Stomper Hyperion (get the zip file version) [https://www.lysator.liu.se/\~zap/stomper/stomper.zip](https://www.lysator.liu.se/~zap/stomper/stomper.zip) and Drumsynth:  [http://mda.smartelectronix.com/drumsynth.htm](http://mda.smartelectronix.com/drumsynth.htm)  though if you want to use Drumsynth on Windows 7 or Windows 10+, use the Oracle VM Virtualbox. There's a Windows XP virtual machine you can download and use to run Drumsynth properly. Make sure you use one of the older ones if you have a lower-end Windows 7 or 10+ machine or you won't be able to disable certain features that require something your graphics card just doesn't have.

Here's the link for Oracle VM Virtualbox:  [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)  \- It might seem intimidating at first but it is pretty easy to set up. Here are some instructions:  [https://helpdeskgeek.com/virtualization/how-to-set-up-a-windows-xp-virtual-machine-for-free/](https://helpdeskgeek.com/virtualization/how-to-set-up-a-windows-xp-virtual-machine-for-free/)  which include a download link for a virtual Windows XP: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002)

And for some awesome free DAWs, you can get the Buzz tracker, Psycle tracker, Linux Multimedia Studio, Cakewalk, and Tracktion. Tracktion Free is basically just an old version that the creators have decided to make freely available. They can all host VST Plugins, and most have their own native plugin instruments and effects. The trackers Buzz and Psycle can be a bit tricky if you are starting out, but a lot of fun once you know how to use them. Others that I like include Darkwave Studio (since it stopped using the OpenCandy installer) and OpenMPT (Modplug Tracker). They also are VST hosts.

Edit: Traction is apparently now called Waveform. Kind of confusing but still great interface - especially for something you can get free.

If you want a simple recording software, look for Audacity of course, but there are other multitracks you can download that might be better. Also look up "The Sonic Spot" on google on the wayback machine. It's a long-defunct music software download site, but it still has working links if you can find it. Great place to look for great stuff. If you have a taste for oldschool mixing programs, look in the internet archive for Tuareg, Tunafish, and Moonfish. Used Tuareg a lot back in the late 90's and early 2000s.

A few extra links:

Sampleradar:  [https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download](https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download) a website with loops and one-shot samples you can download and use for free. No need to pay royalties - just don't reupload them to your site or try to sell them in a sample set and you'll be fine.

2,000 Free Soundfonds:  [https://hiphopmakers.com/over-2000-free-soundfonts-free-soundfont-player](https://hiphopmakers.com/over-2000-free-soundfonts-free-soundfont-player)  it has links to a lot of useful websites for soundfonts and for soundfont (sf2) players.

Polyphone Soundfont Editor:  [https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/](https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/)  make your own sf2 files

Mod Archive Downloads:  [https://modarchive.org/index.php?faq-torrents-current](https://modarchive.org/index.php?faq-torrents-current) Lots of song files and the TMA Waveworld collection - filled with drum and other instrument one-shots. Kiarchive Woolyss chiptune samples are also worth a look.

Drawing and Painting:

For those who want to get into art and are tired of GIMP (which to be honest doesn't respond well to the mouse but is a good photoediting software) I would recommend Artrage and Medibang Pro. Both are free, and last time I checked you can get everything you need with the free version of the Medibang Pro tablet app. (About all you're paying for is more palettes, which you may not really need). They are very responsive to mouse and stylus movement, and both have options to allow you to draw smoother lineart. Pixia and Pierha aren't too bad either, and there is also the old version of openCanvas.

Oldschool artists will probably like Flying Colors and Deluxe Paint 2. Flying Colors is an old Windows 95 256 colour program while Deluxe Paint 2 is a Dos program so you will need DOSBox.

For vector pics, Inkscape is probably your best bet right now. It's not the best vector editor around, but it's free and you can make some very good pictures with it. Heck, if you are skilled enough, you can make professional-quality pictures in MSPaint.
Wolfram Alpha. They have a lot of cool tools for math, science and even things like nutrition
Stackoverflow because I wouldn’t be a developer without it
[Wordhippo](https://www.wordhippo.com)! It is, hands down, the best online thesaurus ever. You can search synonyms and antonyms, and it includes slang, explicit language, and multi-word phrases, all of which are typically excluded in other thesauruses I've used. This feature lets you find both more specific/academic/professional words and more general/slang/colloquial words. It's saved my sanity in term papers and texts alike. When you search a word or phrase, you get a page that breaks down synonyms by meaning and part of speech (check out this page for "[live](https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/live.html)," with 11 verb usages, 13 adjective usages, and 3 adverb usages).

Bonus: I actually ended up usinging to Wordhippo while writing this comment.
https://thenounproject.com/ has a wide selection of icons. I use them for presentations!

Tubi TV. It has a ton of movies. Not exactly box office hits but its got movies and they change every month. Ive watched movies like Fury and Airplane! on there. Best part is you can get it in phone laptop, and Ps4 as far as i know of. 100% free, 100% recommend 

Edit: They also have TV shows and Anime. Ive watched One punch man and Fairy Tale
Turbotaxsucksass.com

It’s created by Hasan Minhaj with a list of websites to file free taxes with direct links instead of misleading users to paying.

Hasan Minhaj talks about it in his Patriot Act Volume 6 episode “Why Doing Taxes Is So Hard”

Edit: Wow, I'm really glad I watched this episode and happened to be on this post at the same time! I just wished this post was sooner than the tax-due date
Thank you /u/rpendleton18 for my first gold! and Thank you /u/EnergyTakerLad for my first plus one award!
If you’re a student or are really trying to stay focused at work there’s and app called The Forest: Stay Focused (I could be wrong but it’s definitely The Forest). It’s a free app that’s available as an extension on Google Chrome or the Apple AppStore. Basically, you plant a tree, set a time limit and you can only go on the sites that you’ve added to the whitelist or your tree will die. It’s designed to stop you from always being in social media while you’re supposed to be studying or doing something productive.
EdX

Its completely free online courses (usually 2-6 weeks per course) taught by professors from top notch universities from all over the world (Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Oxford).  It's just like taking classes from a university (with assignments, lectures to watch, etc.) and the courses are varied and interesting.

Another online use people don't think about is LIBRARIES.  Go to your local library, get a card, and you get a huge selection of books right on your phone, Kindle, laptop, etc.  You check out the books online and you get them on your device for 3 weeks usually.  The book then deletes itself, but you can check the book back out if need be.  It's completely free.

Edit:  here's the [Edx](https://www.edx.org/) link
Khan academy. It's free, free knowledge!
Can't believe I haven't seen anyone say https://www.photopea.com/

Its literally free photoshop, and it's even web based
[7cups](https://www.7cups.com/16640439). It is a free, safe, and anonymous way to talk to trained listeners about anything going on in your life. There are also group chat rooms where you can talk to peers who may experience something similar to you! Couldn't recommend it more.
A fun thing to just check out is [the first ever website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). Something else that's really cool is [The Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/), which essentially contains every possible string of letters, periods, and commas. At first glance it seems a bit uninteresting, until you realize every story, text message, word, thought, the names of every person who ever lived, the names of every person who didn't live, the secrets behind the creation of our universe, are technically within the many many volumes of the library. You can search anything you want in the library and it'll find it for you. It's honestly quite mind blowing.
[Govtrack.us](https://www.govtrack.us/)  

It’s a website dedicated to tracking the bills and votes of Congress. You can find out who proposed what bill, when they did, and when they will be voting on it. Critical for staying in the know

Edit: Turned it into a link so it’s easier to access
[My 90s TV](http://www.my90stv.com/)

This is more of a novelty website to kill some time, but I think it's pretty cool and you can easily lose yourself for hours with nostalgia. It basically uses YouTube videos to simulate watching TV in 90s and you can specify what year you want and what categories you want to see when you change channels.

There is also a [My 80s TV](http://www.my80stv.com/) and a [My 70s TV](http://www.my70stv.com/) and the dev has said they are considering building one for the 2000s.
DaVinci resolve is a great editing software!
I always love the opportunity to be able to talk about [http://archive.org](http://archive.org/) because it is such a wonderful and free resource.

It has millions of free downloads for [music](https://archive.org/details/audio), [movies](https://archive.org/details/moviesandfilms), [books](https://archive.org/details/texts), [software](https://archive.org/details/software), etc. One very popular example is that it is home to [a very large catalog of Grateful Dead recordings](https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead)

There is also [The Internet Arcade](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade) where you can play a lot of classic games along with the [Console Living Room](https://archive.org/details/consolelivingroom) which is similar. They have access to tons of [old PC games](https://archive.org/details/classicpcgames) too and you can even [play the original Oregon Trail online.](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oregon_Trail_The_1990) There's a lot more in [their software section too.](https://archive.org/details/software)

It also has [The WayBack Machine](http://archive.org/web/) which has archived more than 451 billion web pages saved so you can go back and see how websites were years ago. For example, [here's reddit on July 25, 2005](https://web.archive.org/web/20050725010627/http://reddit.com/) a month after it was created.
https://archive.org For the COVID semester I forgot to rent some of my books for reading and this website had everything I needed for free. It’s also the only reliable website where I can watch Norm Macdonald Live too which is always a plus.

Not really take advantage of, but there’s tons of free apps to learn at least a little sign language. I’m like 70% deaf (on top of auditory processing disorder that probably stems from my autism) and I’d really love to meet a stranger that signs. It’s only ever happened once, when some random little kid translated for me at Starbucks.
Free language immersion programs. I’m not just talking about Duolingo.

• Tandem and HelloTalk are FREE language exchange apps. You put in the language you’re learning and it connects you with native speakers that want to learn your native language. I’ve heard of people having problems with speakers using it as a dating app, but I’ve never had that happen myself.

• There are language immersion Discord servers for nearly any language you want to learn. You can usually just google it and find one somewhere. Subreddits for languages oftentimes have their own discord servers.

• Google Chrome has several extensions that will translate phrases for you, teach you new words, etc. without any extra effort. You’re practically learning a language every time you use the internet. (Edit: Gloss, Kypsis, and Langulearn are good ones!)

• If there’s a popular public domain book in English, chances are, it’s been translated and is in public domain in other languages. Usually when learning a language, I’ll try to be able to read The Little Prince by the end of my first year of learning—which isn’t public domain everywhere but is still easy to find, never too expensive, and usually easy to read.

Many websites offer real-time (well, basically) flight tracking. Not just flight status but maps and markers, updating every second of flights all around the world. Updated arrival times.

MIT open courseware. (Only have experience with their Math classes.) It's better than taking the classes from your university professor. 

I am good at math, but I struggled in the university setting. I found myself learning all the material 2 weeks late. The lectures were to a class of 150-300 people, and their was almost always a language barrier preventing me from fully grasping the content until AFTER the test. When I was having difficulty in Calc III due to my heavily accented Russian professor who was only teaching the class because he had a minimum quota of classes to teach each year to stay employed for his research in number theory, my Teaching assistant helped a bit, but not enough.

I found MIT open courseware, and although the teacher had a minor German accent, he wanted to teach. It made a world of difference, and if I missed anything, I could rewind 20 seconds and hear it again. Most importantly, these teachers are absolutely amazing at giving you what you need. The MIT staff are not there because they are super smart, (although they might also be that) but instead because they are the best teachers. I'm convinced anyone who wants to learn can from them.

After that successful turning around of a grade, I used it again for Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. I Aced (100%) both finals for diffEQ and Linear algebra, despite being a C student for most of the semesters in the classes. My only regret is not watching each lecture during the semester, instead of all in a row before the Finals.

TL;DR: you are almost better off watching the MIT open courseware lectures with headphones on a laptop while attending your math classes at a large University than paying attention to your professors.

>Every Noise at Once is an ongoing attempt at an algorithmically-generated, readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical genre-space, based on data tracked and analyzed for 4,555 genre-shaped distinctions by Spotify as of 2020-07-15. The calibration is fuzzy, but in general down is more organic, up is more mechanical and electric; left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier and bouncier.
